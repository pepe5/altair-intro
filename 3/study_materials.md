## theory of non-violence

### [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule)

See at least these study materials for now:
- https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_principle
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_liberty
- http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/10/15/liberty-fist-nose
- https://www.christiancourier.com/articles/9-gold-silver-and-iron-three-rules-of-human-conduct
- http://www.dountoothers.org/newwaytothink.html

1. ***Golden*** one: *Do unto others as you would have them do unto you*. BTW: This includes encouragement to not discard others' opinions [and] not use abusive language. This do not propagate ruthlessness, but exactly opposite: It encourages to ***Emphaty***.

2. ***Silver*** one: *Do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto you*. BTW: It does not inhibit defence need but exactly opposite: It encourages to ***Defense against violence***. It encourage ***Respect*** - on ***Liberty***: *Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else*.

3. ***Brazen*** one: *Repay kindness with kindness*; includes ***Balance*** encouragement: *Do unto others as they do unto you*.

4. ***Iron*** one: *Do unto others as you like, before they do it unto you*. The rule encourages (at least) nourishing ***self-Accountability***. This is practiced in modern (netocracy) Politics.

5. ***Midle-way*** rule: *Time teaches you what to do*: *You start out cooperating and, in each subsequent round , simply do what your opponent did the last time (tit-for-tat). You punish defections, but, once the other player cooperates, you’re willing to let bygones be bygones. At first, it seems to garner only mediocre success. But as time goes on, the other old strategies defeat themselves----from too much kindness or too much cruelty-----and then this middle way pulls ahead.* This rule encourages to ***Emphasize Intelligence***.

### "negative declaration"
Why we use negative declaration of what we are focusing to:

- because we are trying to label by 1 term a position on (at least) 2 factors / dimensions:

We will evaluate "Actor's Activity" (A) on "Body of an object" (B) - from perspective of B:

- if it is non-violent
- or aggressive
- or "something in between":

| A'position | $$\dashrightarrow$$ | B's loose-experience in future |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $$\downarrow$$ | non-violence | A mis-uses B |
| B's loose-experience in present | A pushes B | A's aggression |

We can reflect innumerable dimensions of A's activity and conceptualize them in many thinkable spatial models:

- so here is another example of non-violence factors/dimensions model: **TODO** [5MT](http://plumvillage.org/mindfulness-practice/the-5-mindfulness-trainings)

The reason why negative declaration is more apropriate is that what people don't want (to get from others) is more specifiable. -- What people whish is more subjective in particular situations.

### true friendship / true love
Positive declaration can be based on (5) live-force elements for example:

- A tries to be mindful towards B
- A tries to offer a (kind) freedom to B
- A tries to respect (with remembering) recognized shapes and needs of B
- A enjoys with appreciation values around B
- A is inclusive (because of own solid supportive fitness) to B

(But what it means in particular situations??)
$$\rightarrow$$ beside being careful we can try to "*feel it*" $$\rightarrow$$ by *simplification*:

In (4) immeasurables:
- A mindfully offers a (kind) freedom to B
- A mindfully respects (with remembering) recognized B's own shapes and needs of B
- A mindfully enjoys with appreciation the values around B
- A (with own solid fitness) mindfully supports a B


## live modeling
### "just-labeling" aproach

Beside Golden-rule theory, we have here more pro-systems-oriented models which draws motivations and rules in life-field: concretely [Games-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory).

From this we can see that in society we basically have 2 "propagandas":

1. ***self-centered / relativistic*** model: here win-lost is only option; or at least the option when 1 "gets" it, and 2$$^{nd}$$ "withstand to wait". 
   - on this modeling, whole western civilisation has been built. ***Golden-rule*** (all variants) makes it working on real society.
   - This whole is about "*dualistic*" "self"-awareness, which stands  *self concurring against others*.
   - Modern mainstream (psychotherapeutic) "psychology" propaganda sacrifices it as only valid interpretation of personal motivations. Social aspect then is built around "***Emotional Resilience***".
   - The problem (which is not considered as problem to the proponents) is that here the person is - and always has to be - *selfish*.
   - All dualistic philosophies follow it (economy-market propaganda, psychology, abrahamic systems,...)

2. ***non-self / "absolute"*** model: here win-win is only valid option; or at least fulfilling compassion / inclusiveness as win variant.
   - This builds it's understanding on that "self" (organism with its needs) is always safe - based on healthy living-attitude (which cannot be anyhow destroyed, because is realizable in every circumstances). Therefore both (scared) self-defense and (self) emotional-resilience are here considered as misunderstandings of self.
   - Rather this "self-understanding" is based on (self) "***Identification***" (unification) with actual virtue / wise sensing of a situation.
   - In some modern experimental psychologies, this can be valid if the person is in ***conscious contact*** with all touched bodies: self body is one which is always engaged.
   - The problem (which is not considered as problem to the proponents) is that here the person is - and always has to be - *non-selfish*.
   - This model is usually propagated in monasteries.
   - Even when this model brings so precious value of self-unification, still here it is hard for the proponents to state that something else can be valid model.

3. ***transitional*** model: states it is somehow between: both models are valid to be experienced in some situation.
   - Only known psychological model here currently to me is [NVC](cnvc.org).
   - In introspective trainings, this is reflection of [Sambhogakāya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambhogakāya) state.
   - In western philosophy this can be reflected for example by [Plane of immanence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_of_immanence).


Now, let's return to dominating model, and try to identify weaknesses of that one and try to find spread alternatives around.

Model of ***Emotional Resilience*** pulls practitioner to -

- (*profesional*) *ruthlessness* : it is expressed by saying *"Heed your own problems, instead of problems of others."*
$$\rightarrow$$ This brings up need to teach this practitioners again an warm ***sensitivity***
- unfortunately such sensitivity can go against practitioner goals, and thus s/he chooses **

- This all comes from having *emotional resilience* inseparably interconnected to *professionalism*, which
