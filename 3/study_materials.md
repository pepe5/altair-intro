### "negative declaration"
Why we use negative declaration of what we are focusing to:

- because we are trying to label by 1 term a position on (at least) 2 factors / dimensions:

We will evaluate "Actor's Activity" (A) on "Body of an object" (B):

- if it is non-violent
- or aggressive
- or "something in between":

| A'position | $$\dashrightarrow$$ | B's loose-experience in future |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $$\downarrow$$ | non-violence | A mis-uses B |
| B's loose-experience in present | A pushes B | A's aggression |
