## theory of non-violence

### [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule)

### "negative declaration"
Why we use negative declaration of what we are focusing to:

- because we are trying to label by 1 term a position on (at least) 2 factors / dimensions:

We will evaluate "Actor's Activity" (A) on "Body of an object" (B) - from perspective of B:

- if it is non-violent
- or aggressive
- or "something in between":

| A'position | $$\dashrightarrow$$ | B's loose-experience in future |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $$\downarrow$$ | non-violence | A mis-uses B |
| B's loose-experience in present | A pushes B | A's aggression |

We can reflect innumerable dimensions of A's activity and conceptualize them in many thinkable spatial models:

- so here is another example of non-violence factors/dimensions model: **TODO** [5MT](http://plumvillage.org/mindfulness-practice/the-5-mindfulness-trainings)

The reason why negative declaration is more apropriate is that what people don't want (to get from others) is more specifiable. -- What people whish is more subjective in particular situations.

### true friendship / true love
Positive declaration can be based on (5) live-force elements for example:

- A tries to be mindful towards B
- A tries to offer a (kind) freedom to B
- A tries to respect (with remembering) recognized shapes and needs of B
- A enjoys with appreciation values around B
- A is inclusive (because of own solid supportive fitness) to B

(But what it means in particular situations??)
$$\rightarrow$$ beside being careful we can try to "*feel it*" $$\rightarrow$$ by *simplification*:

In (4) immeasurables:
- A mindfully offers a (kind) freedom to B
- A mindfully respects (with remembering) recognized B's own shapes and needs of B
- A mindfully enjoys with appreciation the values around B
- A (with own solid fitness) mindfully supports a B


## live modeling
### "just-labeling" aproach

Beside Golden-rule theory, we have here more pro-systems models which draws motivations and rules in life-field: concretely [Games-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory).

From this we can see that in society we have basically have 2 "propagandas":

1. self-centered model: here win-lost is only option; or at least the option when 1 "gets" it, and 2$$nd$$ "withstand to wait". 
   - on this modeling, whole western civilisation has been built. Golden-rule makes it
