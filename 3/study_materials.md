## theory of non-violence

### [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule)

See at least these study materials for now:
- https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule
- https://www.christiancourier.com/articles/9-gold-silver-and-iron-three-rules-of-human-conduct
- http://www.dountoothers.org/newwaytothink.html

1. ***Golden*** one: *Do unto others as you would have them do unto you*. BTW: This includes encouragement to not discard others' opinions [and] not use abusive language. This do not propagate ruthlessness, but exactly opposite: It encourage ***Emphaty***.
- ***Silver*** one: *Do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto you*. BTW: It do not inhibit defence need but exactly opposite: encourage ***defense against violence***. It encourage ***Respect***.

- ***Brazen*** one: *Repay kindness with kindness*; includes ***Balance*** encouragement: *Do unto others as they do unto you*.

- ***Iron*** one: *Do unto others as you like, before they do it unto you*; which is practiced in modern (netocracy) Politics.

- ***Midle-way*** rule: *Time teaches you what to do*: *You start out cooperating and, in each subsequent round , simply do what your opponent did the last time (tit-for-tat). You punish defections, but, once the other player cooperates, youâ€™re willing to let bygones be bygones. At first, it seems to garner only mediocre success. But as time goes on, the other old strategies defeat themselves----from too much kindness or too much cruelty-----and then this middle way pulls ahead.*

### "negative declaration"
Why we use negative declaration of what we are focusing to:

- because we are trying to label by 1 term a position on (at least) 2 factors / dimensions:

We will evaluate "Actor's Activity" (A) on "Body of an object" (B) - from perspective of B:

- if it is non-violent
- or aggressive
- or "something in between":

| A'position | $$\dashrightarrow$$ | B's loose-experience in future |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $$\downarrow$$ | non-violence | A mis-uses B |
| B's loose-experience in present | A pushes B | A's aggression |

We can reflect innumerable dimensions of A's activity and conceptualize them in many thinkable spatial models:

- so here is another example of non-violence factors/dimensions model: **TODO** [5MT](http://plumvillage.org/mindfulness-practice/the-5-mindfulness-trainings)

The reason why negative declaration is more apropriate is that what people don't want (to get from others) is more specifiable. -- What people whish is more subjective in particular situations.

### true friendship / true love
Positive declaration can be based on (5) live-force elements for example:

- A tries to be mindful towards B
- A tries to offer a (kind) freedom to B
- A tries to respect (with remembering) recognized shapes and needs of B
- A enjoys with appreciation values around B
- A is inclusive (because of own solid supportive fitness) to B

(But what it means in particular situations??)
$$\rightarrow$$ beside being careful we can try to "*feel it*" $$\rightarrow$$ by *simplification*:

In (4) immeasurables:
- A mindfully offers a (kind) freedom to B
- A mindfully respects (with remembering) recognized B's own shapes and needs of B
- A mindfully enjoys with appreciation the values around B
- A (with own solid fitness) mindfully supports a B


## live modeling
### "just-labeling" aproach

Beside Golden-rule theory, we have here more pro-systems models which draws motivations and rules in life-field: concretely [Games-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory).

From this we can see that in society we have basically have 2 "propagandas":

1. self-centered model: here win-lost is only option; or at least the option when 1 "gets" it, and 2$$nd$$ "withstand to wait". 
   - on this modeling, whole western civilisation has been built. Golden-rule makes it working
