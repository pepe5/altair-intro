## theory of non-violence

### [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule)

See at least these study materials for now:
- https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_principle
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_liberty
- http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/10/15/liberty-fist-nose
- https://www.christiancourier.com/articles/9-gold-silver-and-iron-three-rules-of-human-conduct
- http://www.dountoothers.org/newwaytothink.html

1. ***Golden*** one: *Do unto others as you would have them do unto you*. BTW: This includes encouragement to not discard others' opinions [and] not use abusive language. This do not propagate ruthlessness, but exactly opposite: It encourages to ***Emphaty***.

2. ***Silver*** one: *Do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto you*. BTW: It does not inhibit defence need but exactly opposite: It encourages to ***Defense against violence***. It encourage ***Respect*** - on ***Liberty***: *Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else*.

3. ***Brazen*** one: *Repay kindness with kindness*; includes ***Balance*** encouragement: *Do unto others as they do unto you*.

4. ***Iron*** one: *Do unto others as you like, before they do it unto you*. The rule encourages (at least) nourishing ***self-Accountability***. This is practiced in modern (netocracy) Politics.

5. ***Midle-way*** rule: *Time teaches you what to do*: *You start out cooperating and, in each subsequent round , simply do what your opponent did the last time (tit-for-tat). You punish defections, but, once the other player cooperates, you’re willing to let bygones be bygones. At first, it seems to garner only mediocre success. But as time goes on, the other old strategies defeat themselves----from too much kindness or too much cruelty-----and then this middle way pulls ahead.* This rule encourages to ***Emphasize Intelligence***.

### "negative declaration"
Why we use negative declaration of what we are focusing to:

- because we are trying to label by 1 term a position on (at least) 2 factors / dimensions:

We will evaluate "Actor's Activity" (A) on "Body of an object" (B) - from perspective of B:

- if it is non-violent
- or aggressive
- or "something in between":

| A'position | $$\dashrightarrow$$ | B's loose-experience in future |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $$\downarrow$$ | non-violence | A mis-uses B |
| B's loose-experience in present | A pushes B | A's aggression |

We can reflect innumerable dimensions of A's activity and conceptualize them in many thinkable spatial models:

- so here is another example of non-violence factors/dimensions model: **TODO** [5MT](http://plumvillage.org/mindfulness-practice/the-5-mindfulness-trainings)

The reason why negative declaration is more apropriate is that what people don't want (to get from others) is more specifiable. -- What people whish is more subjective in particular situations.

## true friendship / true love
Positive declaration can be based on (5) live-force elements for example:

- A tries to be mindful towards B
- A tries to offer a (kind) freedom to B
- A tries to respect (with remembering) recognized shapes and needs of B
- A enjoys with appreciation values around B
- A is inclusive (because of own solid supportive fitness) to B

(But what it means in particular situations??)
$$\rightarrow$$ beside being careful we can try to "*feel it*" $$\rightarrow$$ by *simplification*:

In (4) immeasurables:
- A mindfully offers a (kind) freedom to B
- A mindfully respects (with remembering) recognized B's own shapes and needs of B
- A mindfully enjoys with appreciation the values around B
- A (with own solid fitness) mindfully supports a B


## live modeling
### "just-labeling" aproach

Beside Golden-rule theory, we have here more pro-systems-oriented models which draws motivations and rules in life-field: concretely [Games-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory).

From this we can see that in society we basically have 2 "propagandas":

1. ***self-centered / relativistic*** model: here win-lost is only option; or at least the option when 1 "gets" it, and 2$$^{nd}$$ "withstand to wait". 
   - on this modeling, whole western civilisation has been built. ***Golden-rule*** (all variants) makes it working on real society.
   - This whole is about "*dualistic*" "self"-awareness, which stands  *self concurring against others*.
   - Modern mainstream (psychotherapeutic) "psychology" propaganda sacrifices it as only valid interpretation of personal motivations. Social aspect then is built around "***Emotional Resilience***".
   - The problem (which is not considered as problem to the proponents) is that here the person is - and always has to be - *selfish*.
   - All dualistic philosophies follow it (economy-market propaganda, psychology, abrahamic systems,...)


2. ***non-self / "absolute"*** model: here win-win is only valid option; or at least fulfilling compassion / inclusiveness as win variant.
   - This builds it's understanding on that "self" (organism with its needs) is always safe - based on healthy living-attitude (which cannot be anyhow destroyed, because is realizable in every circumstances). Therefore both (scared) self-defense and (self) emotional-resilience are here considered as misunderstandings of self.
   - Rather this "self-understanding" is based on (self) "***Identification***" (unification) with actual virtue / wise sensing of a situation.
   - In some modern experimental psychologies, this can be valid if the person is in ***conscious contact*** with all touched bodies: self body is one which is always engaged.
   - The problem (which is not considered as problem to the proponents) is that here the person is - and always has to be - *non-selfish*.
   - This model is usually propagated in monasteries.
   - Even when this model brings so precious value of self-unification, still here it is hard for the proponents to state that something else can be valid model.


3. ***transitional*** model: states that it is somehow between: both models are valid to be experienced in some situation.
   - Only known psychological model here currently to me is [NVC](cnvc.org).
   - In introspective trainings, this is reflection of [Sambhogakāya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambhogakāya) state.
   - In western philosophy this can be reflected for example by [Plane of immanence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_of_immanence).

- see [NVC Connection](http://en.nvcwiki.com/index.php/Underlying_Concepts_of_Compassionate_Communication)

Now, let's return to dominating model, and try to identify weaknesses of that one and try to find spread alternatives around.

### Model of ***Emotional Resilience*** pulls practitioner to -

- (*profesional*) *ruthlessness* : it is expressed by saying *"Heed your own problems, instead of problems of others."* <br />
  $$\rightarrow$$ This brings up a need to teach this practitioners again an warm ***sensitivity***

- Unfortunately such sensitivity can go against practitioner goals, and thus s/he chooses *insincerity*. <br />
  $$\rightarrow$$ This brings up a need to teach it again in other way: now propagators invented ***authenticity***

- But because this model is still about ruthlessness, it engages to learn and spread *assertiveness*. <br />
  $$\rightarrow$$ How assertiveness failed in large scale is well known. Now propagators invented ***soft skills***. The project became "perfect". All what you get from this is you cannot trust people anymore.

This all comes from having *emotional resilience* inseparably interconnected to *professionalism*, which is a need to win a fight of taking (some) control on "demands market". I consider this 2 propagandas inseparable in current society. So let's identify some concrete failures from perspective of social-situations:

1. Emotional resilience mainly dictates to unconditionally adapt without any ethic self-reflection:
- Ruthlessness expands to whole western society, we are not *brutal* as Sharia-ruled countries are; but in terms of *treating/protecting children* (outside of our families - in neighbors houses and in schools) - we still feels this as pain. Propaganda goes so far that victims are even punished for being "too weak".
- Insincerity made grew *corruption* and prepared society ready to accept netocracy as standard.
- In total, we can sense in contemporary society aggressiveness between different groups of activists. 
- People in cruel societies are encouraged to adapt there: *just for theirs sustainable future*. This makes societies to be unsustainable (from perspective of our values) even more.


- That this never-ending infection of ruthlessness is not cured at all is visible at next attempt: ***[multipliers](http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/2010/06/multipliers_how_the_best_leade.html)*** is approach here to learn 1/ *responsibility of everyone to influence* positively; and 2/ to be positive in sense of intelligence at all. <br />
  $$\rightarrow$$ i'd like to say that this new method brings me hope about new spurt in our cultural evolution; even when- and maybe even because of- fact that this new method brings and (i hope) somehow requires to distinguish between position of "responsibility-excluded" *mate* (which is just trying to vegetate or assertively exploit the surroundings) and position of "responsible" *leader* (which identifies with *mates'* success so much that s/he invests in it as into win-win goal).
  
  * you can see that this role (of *leader*) is much more about *defined hierarchy*; so here theory of *professionalism* comes into challenge:


### Model of ***professionalism*** pulls people to elitarism
1. It is *profesional* to be immoral: because it is more important to be professional than anything else.
2. Profesionalism with unconditional adaption makes people to proclaim socialy spreat conflicts of interests as normal and thus necessary: in modern people management it is already official: "you have to be (morally) flexible".

Actually it seems like *emotional resilience* serves (and is strengthened for purpose of serving) to ***professionalism*** paradigm.

This all here is because "high quality of (professional) service" is necessary to grasp competitive strenght.

- let's try to discuss later alternatives to this blind way.



## Assimilation of wider view

### terms
- ***labelling system*** (*system*) - as already described in (###), we use this term for any particular theory or propaganda. Here we especially mean by that any live-philosophy: In previous days, term used was *personal moral system*. Then some people tried to overcome *over-moralizing* atmosphere of that days and established other naming, but we here use old name even when the practitioner refuses this: The act of refusing is typical act of a moral system...
- ***practitioner*** - Every *labeling system* has it's practitioner. We name just practiced systems as labeling system - there is no labelling system which stays not-practiced. Every labelling system can be practiced in deeper or bad consistency. You can always meet someone who misleads terms of the system to distorted meanings.
- ***paradigm*** - a term of the system which dominates many live situations of the practitioner. There are many paradigms shared between different systems. You can imagine systems as species of living organisms, and paradigms as genes: they "fight" for dominance. In this analogy practitioners are like cells: the amount matters.
- ***resistance*** (of some system against some paradigms) - we can see 2 kinds of it: 1/ active resistance and 2/ passive one. See bellow for examples.
- ***propaganda fights*** - you can see, that some systems are acting friendly to some systems, but others are acting aggressively. Some systems cannot imagine that it is a possibility to not act aggressively to other systems. This itself is propaganda of predator-ship.

### Western psychotherapy
In previous section we described paradigms of *emotional resistance* and *professionalism*. - Those are typical paradigms of this system. As we discussed there already, we see that -
- this system operates healthily in democratic and healthy environment.
- In unhealthy environment it malfunctions - as it vitality relies on psychotherapist: for example there is paradigm of *healing anger*: This works only when you have healthy listener and enough of prepared space.
- more over, this systems seems intolerant to other systems: it seems like it cannot accept other than controlling role to other systems.
- system tends to be ignorant to other instances of it's kind: for example when meeting with propagator of system where contact with personal body is not emphasized, then nothing will move the propagator to emphasize it, even when there are psychotherapies which emphasize it. In terms of our analogy it can be named as predisposition of system's genome to produce blind individuals. This relates with *professionalism*: professional needs to dominate as s/he is, there is no way to grow over borders at moment of act of service.
- when meeting not-blinded instance, it seems as satisfying to experience it's immunity against over-moralizing.
- agnosticism towards ethics is strength and weakness at the same time.

- A success in this system depends on performance of- and experience of- adaptation: even when you have to experience it (inside), still you have to perform it outside.


### Buddhism
- Seems as most mature labeling-system to me. It is very liberal to other systems, while still (actively) immune against paradigms like *righteous anger*.
- It seems that it so much mature because it incorporates models of solitaire masters and models of "man without goal". In general, you are complete perfect with all [5 Chans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guifeng_Zongmi#Ch.C3.A1n_teachings), and if merged with 5 Bodhisattvas $$\rightarrow$$ then all 10 Motivations are perfect and well recognized as protected from *critics aggression* (in sense of *personal* matters; not in sense of general labeling-systems which are always good subject to constructive critics).
- Diversity of its instances is strength and weakness at the same time.
- It seems to be *passively resistant* against *emotional resistance* and *professionalism*: many groups are vector of these diseases.

- In general sense it is agnostic to metaphysics (like dominant god existence, what was “created” when,  and if a man is mainly penetrated by Tao elements or chakra elements, …)
- It is in wide sense agnostic even to if forceful protection is (spiritually) legitimate or not.


How the system operates without these 2 paradigms? ###

### wider view paradigms
In [day-3](https://altair.gitbooks.io/intro/content/3/day-3.html) we said that “*Our goal is to propagate and practice such labeling, where people feel to be welcomed, appreciated (in sense of understanding) and supported (in sense of integration) even when they are not perfectly enriched economically, physically, intellectually, or psychically, or if they are any other way underperforming under lens of dominating religious labeling-systems*”.

- In this sense it can look like we welcome “everyone”; obviously not: we have other requirements than named ones. (You know already them: acceptance of data transparency, private-ownership handling-regulation, will to learn 3E, a position skills and co-house folklore and awareness of own-choice – own-happiness.

In this system, people simply *can* be *underperforming in **emotional resistance***:
- As far as they are *kind*, that moment they can be labile in self-experiencing
- But if they fall to unkind self-expressing, as far as they are *non-directive*, it is still very OK
- If they fall to directive self-expressing, as far as they are willing to be in [Blue-zone], it is still OK

In this system, people simply *can* be *underperforming in **professionalism***:
- Our company offers so reach infrastructure of mentoring and is organizing working positions so much stress-free that people can factually ease and relax in most of professions.
- Let's name some: virtual mentoring, doubled workers, short periods, transparent history against blames, no exceptions in (easy) rules, …
- We encourage our members on all levels of career to ask for assements (of experienced situations): you will only be apreciated (in your career profile) for ***integrative approach***

In this system there is nothing for critics on:
