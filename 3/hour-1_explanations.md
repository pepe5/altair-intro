## Hour-1: explanations {#hour-1-explanations}

### competitions -vs- sharings {#competitions-vs-sharings}

Basically we relinquish from what is called “**_competition fights_**”:

*   Mainstream propagates “competition” as all pervading and therefore “fights” as reasonable.- We do not need none of them.

Let’s list some daily used “competitions” and how they are in reality:

*   child fights for parental attention - learning and growing need -- our acceptance - doing it
*   children “fights”- children tends to fight as all other people tends to 5-elements turbulences. We learn 5 moderated elements as antidote.

Even when we are not here to introspect too much, we still are using following minimalistic introspection tool:

### core-messages overview {#core-messages-overview}

In western terminology it would be most descriptive to formulate it like this:

*   Non-violence
*   Transparency
*   Material hierarchies balanced towards high-quality of human well-being and freedom

We say:

*   1<sup>st</sup> 3E → **_no violence_ **is necessary, we use means to protect us against it; **_kind way_ **is best.
*   2<sup>nd</sup> 3E → **_no lying_** is necessary, we use means to protect us against it; **_transparency_ **is best.
*   3<sup>rd</sup> 3E → **_no privatism_ **is necessary, we use means to protect us against it; way of **_sharing, tracking_** the sharing, and **_both-ways control_** is best.

You can ask, what are those ‘E’s in the 3E:

Those are:

1.  _deep_ **E**cology -based (interaction) attitude to the surroundings
2.  _wide_ **E**thics -based (interaction) attitude to the surroundings, and
3.  _high_ **E**sthetics (interaction) attitude to the surroundings -- in meaning of Esthetic implying on racional interactions

*   It is not much important which ‘E’ you feel as dominant in which 3E training…

But it could be good to relate 3 ‘E’s to kind of social levels:

1.  _deep_ Ecology → **_healthy_** attitude & interaction to _yourself_
2.  _wide_ Ethics → **_warm_** (long-term friendly & functionally fruitful) attitude & interaction to _closests_
3.  _high_ Esthetics → **_harmonic_** attitude & interaction to _society_ -- in meaning of gratef giving to society is what people learns when going out from vulturistic self-understanding in society. Let's be aware about our esthetics criteria: we never use others than 1/ naturality - in health / buddhistic sense, 2/ usefulness - in sense of counting with all participants - including nature inhabitants, and 3/ cleanliness - in sense of transmittance of the field of attention. We reject all styles and styling competing other than on co-houses exchange.

### agreeing on interaction color {#agreeing-on-interaction-color}

#### red {#red}

*   we usually think, that we are coming into interaction with high quality arguing and good reasoning. But actually most of communications and other interactions are not about this.
*   when we are coming into interaction with highest racional formulations and highest compassionate awareness, then we can label “our comer” as red. -- But if we are really in such high rationality and compassion, then we will be for sure able to re-label our posture if it gets different qualities…!

#### violet {#violet}

*   when we recognize in our posture: anger, or ruthlessness, or (other) tendency of dominance, we label our last expressing with violet color: This is like apologizing. (This is absolutely not transition to violet state in sense of company-tracked states. But -) - It is here to bring up to us some drilled actions which have to lead us to way out from violet communication.
*   all competitions are here (no other way)

#### blue {#blue}

*   we usually recognize some _intimate_ “problems”. By labeling our posture as blue, we ask surroundings if they are willing to switch to _our_ blue subject; if not we are obligated to leave common space and enter some intimated one. (Otherwise we are acting in violet…)

Named interactions are here to be mastered by [1<sup>st</sup>-E training - no aggressive “touching”, talking, or thinking].

Next 2 interactions to be trained in [giving up from resources imperialism]:

#### green {#green}

*   as primary goal from inner perspective is to nourish and grow green zone; the same way green posture between neighbours is prefered default one: it is simply sharing.
*   No need on (red) precision -- because we are not in danger of being taken too seriously.
*   No need on (violet) emergency-obligations -- because we are non-violent.
*   No need on (blue) intimacy-carrying -- because we are relaxed between friends.
*   This is to be our daily live: sharing.

#### orange {#orange}

*   from time to time we can feel extraordinary joy: this is not either of red / violet / nor blue, but we are still here to be precise and recognize that in coming with extraordinary joy to share we are coming with some kind of expectation:
*   we expect to have joy be perceived with joy too. So we protect the joy with orange label in advance.
*   as orange is quite near to red, we have the same way to be extra sensitive to others and precise about not to fall to (violet) tryings of dominance...

#### “transparent” {#transparent}

*   we are here - when not labelling “our comer” posture by color - at this moment we are saying to be coming in attitude of “deep listening”: our primary goal in this moment is to listen with full attention, to understand as best friend, and usually not to say anything. This is very healing - and very welcomed.
*   when asked to speak, in this posture, we are talking strictly about what counterpart needs to hear: usually nothing about own impressions or opinions, nothing about him/her - in concrete.
*   we speak in this case about by our best effort in not-lying quality -- [3<sup>rd</sup>-E training - no lying]
*   even when founding training (of [4<sup>th</sup>MT]) is here to help us to be deeply introspecting, still our transparent communication in daily live is not necessarily about this: get as example talking about private money.

Let’s try it:
