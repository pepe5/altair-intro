## Day-3 {#day-3}

*   this is about experiencing 3Es in organizing society

We obviously cannot have issues against 3E life here. We can only talk about our experiences, listen to recorded talks and watch to other’s recordings.

### Main message {#main-message}

*   is not proclaiming idea, that it is impossible to live happily and fully in outside world _when you are strong, healthy, and reach enough_. Definitively it is possible. And we can be in contact with such lucky examples.
*   1<sup>st</sup> main message is that after our training we recall realistically harms of _“even small” violence_, privatism, and lying and thus we are clearly determined to go way free from that.
*   2<sup>nd</sup> main message is that our internal society intensively oriented toward kindness, sharing, and transparency helps tremendously to us to be kind, sharing, and transparent **_easily_** -- without unreasonable effort (as it is in outside world) and thus that it is option available for not so strong, healthy, and reach of us.
