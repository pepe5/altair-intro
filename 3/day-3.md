## Day-3 {#day-3}

*   this is about experiencing 3Es in organizing society

We obviously cannot have issues against 3E life here. We can only talk about our experiences, listen to recorded talks and watch to other’s recordings.

### Main message {#main-message}

*   is not proclaiming idea, that it is impossible to live happily and fully in outside world _when you are strong, healthy, and reach enough_. Definitively it is possible. And we can be in contact with such lucky examples.
*   1<sup>st</sup> main message is that after our training we recall realistically harms of _“even small” violence_, privatism, and lying and thus we are clearly determined to go way free from that.
*   2<sup>nd</sup> main message is that our internal society intensively oriented toward kindness, sharing, and transparency helps tremendously to us to be kind, sharing, and transparent **_easily_** -- without unreasonable effort (as it is in outside world) and thus that it is option available for not so strong, healthy, and reach of us.

### Going for change

Everyone has intention to change something: what we find, learn, and enjoy here is we can go for determined change non-violently:
*   We begin to understand by meditative practice: when we sit/lie and breath: we can say ourself "i do not to move my chest anymore", but this will not go to work: we will *"feel a need"* at some point. 
*   But at this point we can recognize, that we can go for it easily:
    -   without escalation : conceptual one
    -   without angryness : and other emotional escalations
    -   with ease : with sense of safety and familiarity after all
    -   with some level of flexibility
    -   without loose of attentiveness on surrounding

*   We go for this at any kind of need for "move" / change. Let's list some examples for having sense on it:
    -    change in career path
    -    moving to another co-house
    -    tuning balance in work-load of participating members of some work-position in your co-house
    -    call for regulation of social and free-time power of members of your co-house
    -    relocation of some equipment from one co-house to another one
    -    change in culture-declaration of your co-house
    -    change in processes of some another co-house
    -    call for cell mitosis
    -    call for company investment in your co-house
    -    ...

*   Best way how to do this is to get coach and formulate project, but also being with coach without any personal project is good way: work of your coach is -
    -    to setup the project by him-self, and skip any attempts to make you a verbal contributor if you do not wish
    -    to offer to you existing project with similar goals
