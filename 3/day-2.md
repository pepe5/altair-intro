## Day-2 {#day-2}

### _1: no aggressive_ “touching”, talking, or thinking. {#1-no-aggressive-touching-talking-or-thinking}

*   comes from 1<sup>st</sup> MT: “Appreciation of Live”

We start our determination in presumption that our posture is green - simple sharing.

Then we detect quality of our posture by distinguishing answers for following 4 questions:

1.  Do i have energy to do this 3 quality-analysis? (Kindness - Forces - Colors)
2.  Do i have will to be **_kind_**? (Or do i wish-need to communicate something uncomfortable?)
3.  Do i feel safe? (Or do i feel a need to protect myself against moments of interaction?)
4.  Do i have time/energy for these partners - to enjoy moments with them? (Or am i stressed by time or by lack of own energy somehow?)

Then we try to detect if we are not going to think about / plan **_forcing elements_**:

1.  If we see that we have wish / **_expectation to influence the partner_ **in his behaviour or his opinions, → then our posture falls to red-blue zones (including violet turbulence): we step into violet label and → next we try to find / bring up and grow red or blue _protecting qualities_
2.  if our expectation can still be controlled by our concrete contact with high-quality rationality and compassionate respect to our (partners) beings-needs; where **_humanistic-arguing_** is applicable, → we try to hold-up red interaction; see protecting means in [red paragraph]
3.  if we recognize that we cannot control our influence-expectations by respect on racional-kindness, → we acknowledged that we are oriented towards (“fair”) **_competing-fight_** or even (“unfair”) **_hidden-misuse_** fights (realized in communication interactions by rhetorics, netocracy, or hidden participation on social (decision-making) power→ we try to hold-up violet communication situation; see obligations in [violet paragraph]
4.  if we recognize that we are in **_fear or impression of loss_ **(envy, or panic, or pathetic, or whatsoever) about myselves→ we try to hold-up blue communication situation; see protecting means in [blue paragraph]

#### red {#red}

*   we are here to learn and automate habitude of loud repetitive questioning on common-agreement (referring publicized agreement) or referring applicability-scope: Let’s try it:
*   because we record everything, we cannot lose someone’s claim ***
*   because we do not use time-management, we control subject-decisioning by “priority / relevance” of claim to common-subject (shared by wider participants) regardless of timing… ***
*   ***

If we feel _'somehow'_ safe enough to stay in high-quality rational-kindness, we can set up the road of upcoming communication by **_decomposing_ **subject into common parts. This can be especially valuable when one has experiences with frequent change of discussion direction by people which feels to be granted to evaluate subjects in pessimistic tone:

*   When discussion is intended to be about _future of some person_: --> we can ask a participant how s/he is tuned toward the person's goal, before going in discussion to area of means of the person...
*   When discussion is intended to be about _past of some person_: --> we can ask a participant _how is s/he tuned toward the person's_ means, before going in discussion to area of experiences of the person...
*   When discussion is intended to be about some abstract rational solutions --> *** what are his/her favorite means in this matter before going to intended subject
*   When discussion is intended to be about some abstract irrational area --> *** toward labelling schools differing from his/her own labelling.

### 2: giving up from resources imperialism {#2-giving-up-from-resources-imperialism}

by energy of fulfilling possibilities of presence.

*   comes from 2<sup>nd</sup> MT: “Appreciation of Momentary Possibilities”

#### kindness -- tuning {#kindness-tuning}

We spoke about kindness-forces-colors reflecting around red interactions. We said that kindness can be reflected by reflecting 1/communication-needs, 2/safety-needs, and by reflecting 3/external-pressures. Let's look deeper to what this kindness can mean. We can recognize in our level of kindness a creational power. - It is actually kind of tuning in terms of discussion's subject.

Let's drill our ability to reflect participants tuning to some subjects.

*   We can reflect our own tuning by reflecting own qualities of 4-immeasurables, and 5-powers

--> let's do it ***

*   We can reflect partner's tuning by asking them about theirs own 4-immeasurables, and 5-powers in particular subjects and it's decompositions.

- we need here to catch impression of easing effect of such sharing! - this is the purpose of such asking.

--> let's try it ***

#### green -- easiness of sharing {#green-easiness-of-sharing}

#### orange -- joy of sharing {#orange-joy-of-sharing}

### 3: no lying {#3-no-lying}

*   deep and practical understanding of people and our community.
*   comes from 3<sup>rd</sup> MT: “Loving Speech and Deep Listening”

#### “transparent” {#transparent}

Let’s list some subject which are challenging to be free from lying:

*   private money
*   private plans
*   not-known resources
