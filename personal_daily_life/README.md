# Personal daily life {#personal-daily-life}

### Personal day-circle time-bank {#personal-day-circle-time-bank}

So everyone has:

*   8 hrs for sleep
*   6 hrs for “working period”: 3 hrs of obligatory activities, 3 of personal choice
*   2 hrs for “food and walk”
*   3x 1hr for individual meditative techniques and gym
*   4 hrs for family and friends
*   1 hr for hygiena

So we have 16 hrs for awake living and 8 hrs for unawake living (both must be respected - and apreciated):

Example of awake period of “lately getting up”:

*   .33 hr (:20’) for hygiena (-> .33 of 1 hr)
*   .5 hr of meditative technique
*   .5 hr for morning food / family eating (.5 of 4 hrs)
*   2 hrs of 1 working period (eg. with family on field)
*   .5 hr for morning gym (-> .5 of 3 hrs)
*   1 hr of pause period (“lunch”)
*   2 hrs of 2nd working period (eg. with frends at machines)
*   .5 hr of pause period (small food, tea)
*   1 hr of meditative technique
*   2 hrs of 3rd working period (eg. with sangha friends at communication education)
*   3 hrs with family …
*   1 hr of meditative technique
*   .33 hr (:20’) for hygiena
*   ...

#### We are practitioners of Slow-food {#we-are-practitioners-of-slow-food}

- and at as - it is for free :)

*   Everyone with small children is obligated to spend 1 hr from “food and walk” period with family. This can be changed, but not from outside.

#### Personal daily positions {#personal-daily-positions}

We commute most of the time between our co-house’s private and public facilities and use these places to have individual and social enjoyments.

*   private facilities are -in amount- equal to all - also called “personal-comfort” facilities. These have to fully satisfy personal need of “comfort of middle way”. These are “little-bit” minimalistic - but from point of view of poverty - these are big social advantage. Most important here is that no one can take it away from you: it cannot be a subject of heritage fights, nor object resolving business failure.
*   it includes defined “flat” tent, personal flat facilities, survival kit, personal IT facilities, daily food product, daily hygienic product, monthly comfort product, and “private/family garden of moment living”
*   salary, taxes, and insurances are implemented in non-cash form - these are -as mentioned- equal for all and thus those are not interesting from perspective of career.

*   public facilities are very reach - we rely on them in both our free time and working time: It allows us to live in healthy, reach, comfortable, brave, and humanic manner.
*   these includes everything non-private like: infrastructure, public/free areas, service areas including “factories”, farms, hospitals, museums and so on -- all are public and thus publically accessible. (Where hygienic restrictions applies, there visitor must pass through hygienic procedures.)
*   all work is done here - and thus during all work periods you are publicly accessible. But this doesn’t mean you “have to be disturbed”: you can ask for “private comfort” and then you will be only watched by colleagues and visitors.

We have 2 expected work outcomes: 1/ obligatory products and 2/ personal-career outcomes

*   **_obligatory products_** are quite minimalistic they includes (3): 1/ minimal food product 2/ minimal technical service and 3/ minimal social service. Minimal technical service can be directed / in required form -- if one requires to consume something specific “afterwards”. This can happen if one breaks something (private or public).
*   actually - breaking something happens quite frequently, but most of facilities are “in the store” prepared for immediate replacement. So only work required in this case is to perform replacement - or if qualification is not deep enough - assisting replacement is required
*   by co-operating in obligatory periods, you are allowed to move in your “_garden_/_field_” as _member_, and in other places as _visitor_.
*   people are feeling safe and refreshed in theirs fields, but also they feel taste to enter “more” - this more is (always) part of some co-house. So thus you are getting “real job” - thing which you do for fun and as a fan:

*   **_personal-career outcomes_** are all the rest of work periods outcomes. These outcomes are tracked by [Personal Record]s and are base for personal career.
*   to be a member of co-house brings you accessibility to use it’s facilities targeted to the members. These are, what we are proud of to maintain, to engineer, and to offer. These include many things which mainstream usually cannot imaginate else then “private”: eg. tractors, food-producing machines, clothes-producing machines, housing facilities-producing machines, fields, materials, sheds,...
*   How dynamics of materials queues, and workers queues flows - see at [Green zone] and [Detailed Intro]

After 4-6hrs long (in average) working period we have period of **_free time_**, where we enjoin _entertaining facilities_: public ones & houses-holded ones:

*   public facilities (i.e. those available to all our members) are placed all around the area and maintained by public-facilities co-houses / fan-clubs.
*   Many people choses 4-5hrs work-mode + 3+4hrs **_volunteering_**-mode of theirs co-house integration.

### Farming period {#farming-period}

*   to “have” basic garden is obligatory for all! It is one of key values implementing personal healthiness.
*   Inner basic school train this as 1 of 3 mandatory subjects (farming, “flat” assembling, & labeling-schools insight)
*   Our farming is holistic activity: we train to perceive, introspect, and express during “work”:- **_nature-contact joy_**- **_understanding plants joy and with animals compassionate join too_- _joy from healthiness and easiness of doing it:_ **physical and tech farming: use of technical tools during farming is comfortably easy.
*   If one is not vegetarian - after basic-school graduation, every such person is obligated to do or to assist in “kind” killing, and from-scratch preparation of meat.
*   As basic-school training learns: we all are used to do daily growing of:- all local kinds of vegetables, fruits, gains, pulses, and spices- linen, and hemp- sheeps for wool and milk -
*   - optionally for meat- cows for milk, optionally for meat and skeleton parts like leather- chickens for eggs, optionally for meat and other uses- rabits, gooses, and wild animals in limited use
*   We do not allow mass hunting and mass killing- we do not allow mass stabling (nor for small animals), and mass milking

…

### Tech period {#tech-period}

*   most of positions are about to work as **_Plumber, Mechanic, Operator, & Repairer_**
*   Inner middle-school is about this - it is required to go through wide range of “Plumber” works. “Repairer” areas in middle-school is training in maintenance of “almost all” parts of “flat” tent.
*   By basic-school graduation everyone gets his own flat-tent. First few lessons of middle-school are made as visit in each this fresh owner with technical details physically.

…

*   all used “matterials” / facilities actually must be somewhere produced - and we try to produce as many as possible of them

#### intro to used materials {#intro-to-used-materials}

*   we do not use note paper - we are electronics oriented in matters of KB and archiving
*   we do not use private cars nor public transportation - see [green zone >> transportation]
*   we almost do not use fosil-oil fuels: we use only renewable powers

### Social period {#social-period}

*   labeling-schools insight trainings are 1 of 3 major parts of social period. (Insight cultivation, + Health cares, & Profile tunings.)
*   at least one working period must be spent with family - if man has “small” children: this is spreading to mainstream slowly too - community-schools. Usually it is social period which is used for this.
*   at high-school age, we are learning detaily interdependencies; many adults use this chance to use theirs social-period to show adolescents how much we are inter-connected:
*   we show and learn how to be with small babes -- needing care
*   we show and learn how to be with elders and dyings -- needing care
*   we show and learn how food and materials flows -- we track them and learn selected handlings
*   we show and learn how machine components flows -- we track them and learn selected handlings
*   we show and learn how _installments and certifications_ -- we track them and learn selected handlings: this is actually very important knowledge: are adolescents educated well which work-positions requires different certifications?
*   we learn by visiting (or at least by authentic documentaries) modern corporation-cared slaveries: we visit and learn how to deal with seizuring executions, with concrete people where it destroyed a family. We visit victims of violent systems like “[religion-based justice](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/actions/two-sisters-sentenced-rape-demand-justice-india-womens-rights)”, refugees in camps, ghost towns, hungry children. Of course seizures, victims of drugs, guns, and hungriness - those all are victims of inequality, which is inability to share legally and sustainably, which has 2 components: 1/ability to stop ones who want to dominate, 2/be safe in place where share starts to happen.

#### Labeling-schools _insight trainings_ {#labeling-schools-insight-trainings}

*   see the [[Labeling-related chapters](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bL-5H8bjC9cv44mUtVac-AXXQLBJrwYI-4Ir6JYhd3w/edit)]

#### Immunity against assertivity {#immunity-against-assertivity}

*   Assertivity is behavior against our “company culture”. We train ourselves 1/ in how to inhibit it and 2/ in how to be immune against it.
*   It is most common area is communication in work - about cooperation asks, about mitigating roles, and about work non-related subjects.
*   Most used mean for our immunity is phrase: “_you are talking about future results timing. I am not going to promise it._”

**_work non-related subjects:_**

*   place holder cannot ask newcomer - if s/he can get lunch out of his/her family- if s/he can get holding duty- if s/he can do some work-non-related favorsetc.
*   if place holder (or other senior) will do this, then anybody or at least whistler will mark this point in transcript as matter to repair…
*   see more in [Indicators drill]

**_all asks are analyzed and evaluated to personal profile_**

*   actually all given asks are analyzed and evaluated during social period - training sessions

#### _Diversity-insight trainings_ {#diversity-insight-trainings}

*   another domain in need of deep insight trainings are _culture-temperament-&-predispositions diversity_. We understand as well as _common_ “human-kind” valueas, also diverse beings conditions as well. -- We rely on “healthy diversity” as much as on common values. -- But in main-stream propaganda is “balance” between equality-&-diversity very unluckily misunderstood.
*   1st thing to train & experience is basic fact (actively cultivated) that no our common value is here to harm “healthy specialities” of individual or group. In counterpart - we cultivate & enjoy only those specialities which are healthy: those which do not harm common values. We are here to experience & become confident about that everything what we do in our healthy live-posture in any moment - is _harmonic_ to both common values and to specialities of me and of near-byes.

we train this by well established “container” of opening, closing, and supporting “minimal best practices”:

*   we give a time (at opening, at closing, and at enduring moments) to experience and to share experiences of joy and safety in moments facing diversity: we bow and smile to people of different colors, different labeling-schools, different fashion, different eco+farming+livelihood strategies. We ask them to ensure us honestly and concretely that and how they preserve happiness, health, & fullness of them own & of others.
*   we give a time to experience and to share experiences of moments of learning deep acceptance of people diversified from us. We experience and to share experiences of saing: “_hmm - they do it so differently - and I feel ..._”

of course there are postures, arrangements, emotional-sayings, labelings, & organizational-structures which are not considered “healthy” by us - and they are disallowed in our company.

*   we maintain list of them - concrete descriptions, camera recordings, and large & deep commentary forums & analysis. -- These forums & knowledge-bases remains always open and all time accepting new (relevant & constructive) contributions - mainly about relations to similar situations and theirs pros+cons.
*   people are encouraged to contribute by theirs personal experiences and thiers personal solutions. We share it on regular bases - as we share and use knowledge-bases of our technical and health-care best-practices. It is our 1 of common value - to share this.
*   we always maintain mindfully sense of fact that a common value (which we preserve and nourish) can be done by more parallel implementations (from which every one his most fitting - by his taste).

We always describe:

*   what is harmed by a “black-listed” posture / activity
*   what are possible solutions - with links to its practitioners
*   what are similar situations + SWOTs

### Average -- Boards {#average-boards}

We described “average person” day cycle. But customizations can go to big differences. Generally speaking, we protect people by theirs rights, and resources by queues and sustaining rules. - So when someone wants to get oriented in this areas fastest, then s/he should look into rights details for people and into queues&rules for resources.

Basic principle is that:

*   for personal comfort - we have enough resources always available in surrounding transit-sheds and service-houses;
*   for personal realization-fulfilment we have enough queues and couches available.

#### Timings {#timings}

**_maximal work timings_**

*   we already described, that people can have some big hoby - and then they can spend on that up-to 4 hrs (with 2 hrs of break)
*   accountability limits and regulations ***

**_minimal work timings / minimal service revange_**

*   everyone have to spend 3 hrs a day by defined Farmin, Tech, & Social service.
*   most of adults do it with pleasure - as time for relaxation / guided study exploration - children & newbies are guided to learn it to joyful way
*   these obligatory 3 hrs are filled by carefully chosen activities - there are 3 check-points - if you do more than is described - you have to relax!
*   these 3 hrs are meant as realization of “self-care” - on most-fundamental level: health, food, family. Next 3 hrs of work period are meant for “self-realization”: man should use them for attaining his/her wishes: if those are not used anyhow, man is couches if s/he has some troubles blocking his/her “self-realization” energy to flow.

**_free time - occasional consumption resources_**

*   we have also wishes about other things than “self-realization”, for example fun :)
*   ***

**_living place - long-term occupation resources_**

*   we have also wishes about other things than “fun”, for example family & live-place
*   ***

#### Example of use-boundaries in ablution {#example-of-use-boundaries-in-ablution}

For example, when one wants to enjoy fun in spas ***

*   one can use in time out of 3hrs basic - his own mini-shower:
*   here available water, heating, soap, towels, & wearing - one can use
*   ***

When family wants enjoy private bathing, ***

*   ...

#### General states-flow {#general-states-flow}

We tranzite between “zones” on individual level too - mostly by biometrics. (See [protectors service])

*   normally we are in green state: our biometrics are in healthy biorytm - our neighbours too
*   when anomaly raises, IT-kit switches to yellow state: protectors gets alarm to focus attention on. They analyze biometrics, sounds, neighbour states, and history of all mainly.
*   when situations is very bad, they switch us to red state: which means they asks for our attention and for cooperation. Red state means we are not protected by company from public law or public service (fire-workers, doctors, police) has to be called to save us. Cooperation is crucial here to make us reliable to continue in company.
*   when situation is violent but does not urgently need (outside) public service, then we will get violin state: this is order to stop any physical contact immediately and calm down by lying down. The violin state calls all near-bies to come and swap ration to side of pacifiers.
*   when situation is OK but still needs something special, they switch us to blue state: we are protected by company, we have ensured privacy, and helping support.
*   when analysis didn’t boiled down to red or blue but anomaly still continues, they switch us to orange state: they are ready to help us - best attitude will be to contact them.
*   when they considered our situation to be very OK, they switch us back to green - and we are clean then again.

This is mainly protection of children and other unpowered.

But it really effectively protects parents & keepers too: they always can ask for support, and they cannot be accused of something what they didn’t do! For example, when teacher falls to situation being in danger of violence, then s/he has: 1/ own record of all details, 2/ discipline-history of all engaged, 3/ comparison of similar records, 4/ possibility to call anybody by the system - which is in our company culture always appreciated: we never work alone.
