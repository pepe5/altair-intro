### Benefits & Sanctions {#benefits-sanctions}

*   private properties are 2: 1/ “personal-comfort” facilities and 2/ stock shares
*   stock shares cannot be taken away / buyed from company nor sold for private money - they “only” ensures that all owners will go down if one will go down…
*   biggest sanction is firing out
*   2nd biggest -also usual in company forms- is warning letter

**_Main benefit -- is personal career_** -- specialization qualifications

*   We build personal qualifications by going deep in specializations in sequence of working positions on certain working place. -- Normal, isn’t it…
*   1st is **_observer_** position - anyone can be observer anytime anywhere.
*   **_guided_** position - can pass anyone too. By going through queue there - and through safety and hygienic procedures - and do it.
*   **_trainees_** position queue - is already limited one. We aspire here to be trained in all necessary tasks in the place and to become unsupported self-reliant:
*   **_operators_** - can do by him/her-self junior tasks - is _place worker_. Every place have this workers twice. -- See [working place]. They can qualify by:
*   **_seniority trainees_** and become -
*   **_- trainers_** - and -
*   **_seniors_**. These workers has itinerary and travel around places in need. -- They: seniors together with seniority trainees always. -- There should not any senior alone because it will decrease his profile renome.
*   Then we do not count seniority by more labels - we simply count number of performed tasks. (Tasks are highly categorized - and described in many materials.) So after all, all - observers, trainees, juniors, and seniors travel around working places and collect **_points in task categories_**.
*   We do not measure speed. -- Our obligatory activities are obligatory in very slow pace.

### Personal Records {#personal-records}

*   - is 1 of 2 key means for common heritage (beside “company” physical properties)

*   All physical work / actions are audio-visually tracked & public.All private actions are tracked at least acoustically. -- We have communities which share private-time knowledge visually too.
*   All concrete inet actions are tracked & public.We records things in “type-scripts” - in strong digitalization (Webkit/XULRunner): every graphical entity on screen which represent (unicode) character is recorded as character - not meaningless picture.
*   (personal abstractions -like Profile is- can be customized on publicity)

…

In terms of technical maintenance of recordings, we label multiple times every “byte” of recording by its “permissions mode” equally to states/zones: and let’s mention here for 1<sup>st</sup> time **_grey zone_**: which is initial - and “as grey market” - unwanted. So: we have these evaluators:

*   _machine_ - makes initial evaluation transiting from grey mode
*   _op_ - makes initial evaluation when yellow personal-state is alarmed
*   _engageds_ - They can one for transition too.
*   _protectors_ - Bunch of qualified (police-mans, lawyers, psychologists, company representants, abbots, …)
*   _protector of hard knowledge-bases_ - this periodically elected specialist makes final resolution for the moment. (Till next voting on the recording, or till next protector elected.)

We have generally 2 paths where settling of recording mode can go to:

*   from grey to -
*   green - when machine evaluate biometrics as normal, and no non-green is around
*   orange - when surrounding activities and peoples are in orange, …
*   red - when everything indicates representative quality

*   from grey to -
*   yellow - when something needs attention
*   blue - when persons need protection of privacy
*   brown - when privacy should be transitioned to company-owned

*   to white mode - special IT ections are required. -- See [White zone]

### Personal Profile {#personal-profile}

Everyone has its copy in his/her “personal IT facility”, it contains mainly list of:

*   performed tasks and
*   received feedbacks
*   sent feedbacks
*   consumed hrs of service - we try to consume much :)
*   consumed / broken materials, & energies - we try to consume as average consumes
*   accepted roles - communities:when one commits to do something as obligation - he enters by this to community of similar people. This is very useful. Let’s name 4 biggest communities we have: private-tracked, private-closed (i.e. visually), vegetarians, & hunters. (Anyone can quit any such obligation any time - by certain procedure.)
*   places subscriptions:In contrast to previous -where accepted tasks where labeled by category- here are tasks labeled by concrete place+time. By-this-made communities are usually much smaller. Here are mainly place-work roles and meetings visible - both to past, present, and future.
*   public interests, priorities, (non-feedback) commentaries, and visions- used as “fuzzy watch-dogs” - when it is fed to search-engines

#### Customization by closing from publicity: {#customization-by-closing-from-publicity}

*   personal + family anamneza
*   queues + watch-dogs subscriptions
*   private interests, priorities, (non-feedback) commentaries, and visions- used as “fuzzy watch-dogs” - when it is fed to search-engines
*   private complaints issues - tracking and progress

…

#### Personal career circulation: {#personal-career-circulation}

We use “_house-hold circulations_” for these purposes:

*   primarily - it is prevention against power-cumulation of people which intentionally or unintentionally fell to imperialistic relation to theirs surrounding
*   next - it helps people which fell to “mentality of poverty” - to enjoy travelling and refresh
*   next - it strongly supports our values: diversity and atmosphere of welcoming. -- To have records about being welcoming (both people & our values) are 1 of most important part of personal profile.
*   next - it makes our organizational and technical equipment for **_free movement_** living, flowing, and well prepared

This obligatory circulation also makes 1 important thing:

*   when choosing which service work-room one is going to use: s/he can orientate by current “personal equipment” of the future co-house.
*   - by this, personal career becomes real business.

### Stream profiles {#stream-profiles}

We track flow of materials and services in detail. We try to cover every used categories of facilities both by primary tracking or calculated one. As we are not eco-centric, but humans-centric, we define tracking ‘backwards’: we start identifying tracked class at point of consumption, and then we are looking for its origins.

We have of course eco-centric fans, which tries to track things, but this is not obligatory.

We measure:

*   amount of consumed class
*   frequency of transmittions and

### Regulators - Auditors, Whistlers, Police-caller/s {#regulators-auditors-whistlers-police-caller-s}

…

### Tech Infrastructure {#tech-infrastructure}

*   all medias are encrypted - this prevents from media stealing
*   all communication is encrypted - this prevents from wiretapping

We have these technical areas maintained here:

*   IT infrastructure - its maintenanse
*   Personal Kit Mech: includes personal tent things, personal IT kit, & other personal things
*   Primary Techs (0-level techs): are things for farming, fabricating clothes, and basic infrastructure facilities - like toilets, cookers, fridges, roads & pipes, … -- Is also cold “heavy technics” & is based on open-HW movement.
*   Basic-comfort Techs (1st-level techs): tents, IT, and common-spread hi-tech facilities fabrication. Intensively changing in releases to make it free from non-compliant corporation business.

-- in these areas - production covers whole our population.

*   Pioneering-comfort Techs (2nd-level techs): is also called “Techs in Beta” -- are things spread only in fan-groups; use is allowed in private periods; every-one can join the groups.
*   Research Techs (3rd-level techs): are techs before Beta testing -- are things where use is not yet standardized and documented; & thus private use is not allowed; still -of course- everyone can join the research - in working periods.

Our technical goals:

*   we will not use _crude oil_ (nor for combustion, nor for plastics)
*   we will not use “hunted materials” (mainly by [mining in africa](https://www.google.cz/search?q=precious+metals+mining+in+africa+human+rights))
*   we will not lift heavy things (such works will be disallowed at us)
