### co-houses hierarchy {#co-houses-hierarchy}

To get basic overview on levels of accessibility, we have

*   “**_personal fundament_**”: we hierarchize coverage of needs on “need fundament”: to feed yourself and to maintain personal-tent (to house yourself) is matter of every individual, it is learned at **_basic-school_**
*   “**_primary_**” public-fans clubs: to be able to **_build your tent, & to fund your garden_**: is quest for **_primary co-houses_**. In this 2 areas we are completely independent on level of co-house itself: (So we do not need to get money or even loans for this.)

### example on tractor {#example-on-tractor}

Imagine, you wish to work on field with tractor, and unluckily your current co-house doesn’t have it, so -

*   you will move to co-house 30kms to east, where tractors are mounted and
*   after 3 months of newcomers training, you will gain the full-membership and get that machine to “intensive” _use_.

But you have to understand, that tractor is co-house property. (Only KIT is your private.)

*   So because it is era of tractors, many other members came in these 3 months and joined the tractor’s queue: you are about 20 people per the machine currently
*   This is because engines monolytes didn’t arrive long time already.

So you decided with co-house board to fund 2nd co-house making little-bit different engine.
