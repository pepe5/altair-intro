## Clusters INTRO {#clusters-intro}

*   Now, let’s name it in short:

### Personal minimum -- Public’s fan co-houses {#personal-minimum-public-s-fan-co-houses}

*   We live in nice places, and we have to do very few things to be feeded and housed.

See [Relation between 3hrs “obligatory” - and 3hr “cereer” IOs]

*   Our “primary richness” is enabled by our ability to be highly precise in positions which serves “almost automatically” every client: It comes from secondary-sector products: massive production from Public’s fan co-houses.In other words - deeper in turn, this is enabled by our education quality: enabling people to taste and enjoy personal-career chances:

See [Details on typical life situations at 3 hrs “personal career” period]:

### Secondary enriching -- dominant career {#secondary-enriching-dominant-career}

*   We can visit as many great places, and enjoy theirs services as theirs clients just for free.
*   Our “secondary richness” is enabled by our ability to be volunteers in positions which serves “almost individually” every client.Deeper in turn, this is enabled by our education quality: enabling people to taste and enjoy social aspect of our creativity [services-sector].

### Tertiary enriching -- unique-offering projects {#tertiary-enriching-unique-offering-projects}

*   This is how usually people the meaning of “Project” term imagine.
*   Some person, or some co-house, or some fans-club defines project and goes to attract Suppliers and Clients for it. The unique-ways Queue can eventually become a persistent Queue by reaching good statistics.

### SMART Projects “Management” {#smart-projects-management}

*   *** as you can see ***, most of persons and most of co-houses whatever sector it is, it’s working on a _“Project”_, which is important for _openness_ of the think. We can imagine projects as time-dimension / conscious counterpart of space-dimension / unconscious Queues.
*   People see what you try to build up, and they can join.
*   People from other co-houses see what you are trying to build up and thus they can start to work on supplies.
*   People from all over the Company see what you are trying to build up and thus they can vote for you during investment Titles.

As everything is (in) Queue here, the same way you can see that everything is (in) Project:

*   Everyone can fill the SMART monitor to start a tracking tool.
*   Most of our fan-clubs (both co-housed and virtual ones) are grouped around some Project -- usually some-Queue run-Project.

Because any Queue defines a Clusters around it (The Producers and The Clients), the Project defines Cluster-run start (and continuation).

#### vertical perspective

*   Our companies cluster is Project (of Blue-network services) of which you you are engaged member!
*   Our public services is Project (of our great public services) of which you you are engaged member!
*   Our villages are Project (of self-sustainability) of which you you are engaged member!
*   Your co-house is Project (of it’s Charter) of which you you are engaged member!
*   Your career can be focused on moving some Project forward too.

#### horizontal perspective

*   Our ***KB-project*** drives our *knowledge-base* it includes
    - Qs-catalog: focuses on IOs; see [[Queues]]
    - Products-Catalog: focuses on what mainstream emphasises: see [[Qs to consumptions]]
    - Solutions-catalog: 
    - Documentation-project (about external projects) and -
    - Projects-catalog itself

*   Our ***People-capital*** - project: drives web-portal for public and for newcomers. We do not name this "HR"; even when Capital is very similar meaning as Resource is. Here term "Capital" is chosen because it labels also *value* of man to him/her self itself.

*   Our ***tech-project*** drives our technology-equipment: votes about IO priorities and about investments needed
