## Personal daily move {#personal-daily-move}

Previous chapter were oriented towards timings, this one is describing geography.

Our landscape looks like this:

| open-land: | public-land | eg: grassland, forests, lakes, fields,... |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | public-facilities - non-flats | eg: roads, sheds, pub-trans. vehicles, spas,... |
| public shares: | gardens of public co-houses | ie: fields, plants, & toolings of our great pub-fans |
|  | public-zones of co-houses | ↲ publicly walkable-through, eg: toilets, kitchens,... |
|  | public-flats of co-houses | ↰ accessible for “visitors”, ie: places for personal-kits |
| co-house shares: | co-house | eg: factories, hospitals, work-rooms,... |
|  | co-garden | eg: open-air care-expensive facilities, eg: tractors |
| private-land: | personal-garden | eg: "cell-parking" slot, field, plants, & toolings “locked” for a person |

### areas publicly walkable-through {#areas-publicly-walkable-through}

*   All publicly walkable-through areas are here available for “use without modifications”. We rely on walkable-through landscape which is physical implementation of our transparency.
*   Any modifying consumption is tracked - as you move in “public” - transparent from both sides (yours and maintenance)

For example you can anytime walk through **_personal-garden_** of someone else, enjoy look, enjoy touch, but never modify anything without agreement of the person.

### areas for “visitors” {#areas-for-visitors}

“**_Public-flats_**” are always public-facilities nearest to maintaining co-house, because -

*   those are most care-expensive,
*   those are here to implement easy access of co-house members to theirs work-positions

### “_move -- get moved_” intro {#move-get-moved-intro}

Important part of understanding is what we have available _where_. For descriptions of general understanding see [red zone - markets intro ***]

*   public facilities- available just at your place -- by not-owned sheds
*   “expensive” facilities- you have to change residence “for them”

Let’s divide the daily consumption to 4 categories:

1.  caring and consuming just things which you already have, or which produce by your-own
2.  getting and consuming things just available by public sheds
3.  going for and getting things available for clients of near-around co-houses
4.  going for things available for members of co-houses in general

### example of use on highly-expensive wishes {#example-of-use-on-highly-expensive-wishes}

*   *** expensive house → find nice co-house
*   *** expensive work-place (like cosmos, hi-tech lab, …) → see [tractor]
*   *** place non-related (like journey around the world) → find traveling fans-club: theirs network of co-houses...
