# Commentaries on outer structures and outer values {#commentaries-on-outer-structures-and-outer-values}

*   We fully support all tries of implementing non-violence, living without loans, ecologic and voluntarity engagements.
*   We fully support all Local-economics, all tries to live without corporations, all tries on direct democracy and transparency.
*   We fully support all Local-communities -- tries of implementation specific (humanic) values. -- Let’s cooperate!

#### slavery relationships {#slavery-relationships}

*   These are all situations where is no encouragement or guidance how to escape.- We provide guidance about escaping at all possible situations.
*   *** modern slavery ***We are here to stop hiding against what terrible situations our governments and corporations constructs and keep going. Let's name some:
*   all “markets” with guns, slavers, & drugs
*   all legalization of homeless states, personal bankruptcy, household executions, …
*   all “work” positions against healthiness or family life and/or without real guidance how to gain healthy one

#### concurrency fights {#concurrency-fights}

*   *** hidings during selling ***
*   *** corruptions in competitive tenderings ***
*   *** fights between colleagues ***

Most powerful arming in these fights is oversimplification during contemporary chattings:

*   We have to learn how to distinguish in our daily naming between means suitable for reach and poor ones: for example to leave in city for reach ones can be healthy as far as these people own other means - mainly enslaving power above theirs slaves.
*   We often hear "be flexible" and in detail unfortunately it means "be cheating, be unfair, or even be violent if necessary".

#### fails in treating children and other weaks {#fails-in-treating-children-and-other-weaks}

*   we (believe and) work hard on having capacity to feed anybody who joins us
*   we (believe and) work hard to have capacity to feed and carry anybody immobile who joins us
*   we (believe and) work hard to have means to save any our member against violence

#### monetary forces {#monetary-forces}

*   we basically are not against money at all: we use them as a company a much, - But - we _refuse to feed ourselves by business_: because monetized abstraction abstracted us away from our basic right: to be vitally inter-connected with health primary-source: carrying garden and to grow in garden.
*   On the other hand - we do not fall to other extreme: we do not “spend whole life and body” in garden: we are going to join the garden, but only in “_convenient_” way, and few hours a day. (And we are not there to do serf “job”).
*   ownership - and monetarily defined ownership is the core of this problem: we experience unavailability of sophisticated facilities in mainstream culture because we fell to view where privately-owned things are not for sharing.

To say that money do not create these negative monetary forces is like to state that guns do not create large-scale killing. (Soldiers and mafia workers can be careful "not to kill" rather just to immobilise...) We need to be brave to look onto how particular technology used makes particular strategies easy! About these hard monetary forces you can best study at [zeitgeist educational archive], but let's name most impacting ones here:

*   **_non-discrimination between companies and households_**: fundamentally destructive impact of (big) loans on (quite poor) households: Destructing most basic functioning of household: reproduction of national population and (emocional) care of children of the households. (Do you know to where population of original inhabitants of the country is going? Do you know who “balance” total fertility rate? - I mean do you know immigration fertility in the country?)
*   **_netocracy of “democracy” representatives_**: big corporations destruct most fundamental functioning of democracy: Representatives no more represent res-publica, but percept themselves as too dependent on corporations and thus (corruptedly) serve those. (In these days, banks cannot bankrupt from owner perspective; only from clients perspective...)
*   **_unavailability to start own business_** without falling to loans; not saying to start from scratch without loans at all. This has 2 aspects:
    1.  inability to start (small) business without corporation-oriented technologies: markets are (blindly) oriented towards **_goods_** producible only by extremely expensive technologies (mostly artificially cost-increased). Even technologies - usually fabric-placed _big machines_ for reasonable goods like gardening tractors, biogas stations, stirlings and so on are reasonable it point of sharing: and monetized “sharing” pushes non-holders to “worker-only shareholder” - actually slaves holding nothing. This is yet made more solid defensible by [patents and licensing]
    2.  inaccessibility of end-consumers (households) for small businesses: where plebs is going to give theirs moneys: in “market plazas”. Those are not **_markets itself_ **in original sense: there are no other sellers than corporations. How you could reach household consumers as non-corporation?

At these days: the match for household consumers is finished: corporations grasped the market.

*   **_work market quality_ **- from households perspective: we experience extremely bad conditions for labors in terms of salary, shift-timing, labor-unions, and more - even with this conditioning oriented towards companies, still the market is unstable: because of “_crises_”. In these days, crises will come again and again - artificially, because bank owners have only profit from it.

#### imperialism hierarchies {#imperialism-hierarchies}

*   **patents and licensing**: ***get as example simple wish about instalment and usage of small-farm-sized biogas station. Only way to there is to pay a certified company - which obviously doesn’t specialize on too small station components... Even if you know how to install all components according to most precise norms, you still have to pay certified company for that. Even to be “bio producer” is made as highly expensive business just by these certification. Best way from this self-lock is actually our “business plan”: we are going to collect reasonable amount of _“knowledge” (certification) holders_ and [big machines] (those reasonable only when shared) and become a company / cluster of companies which in theirs sharing breaks through this system-based slavery.
*   *** ownerships of land-resources and materials-resources***
*   **_bad design_**: in many areas, we are enslaved between badly designed facilities: recall how you were not able to get simple small component of printer, of toilet, of kitchen technology; recall how expensive are things to “modern” cars, and “modern” houses. Those are not real prices, those are not senseful limits in availability. That all is here only for corporations benefits. → Let’s choose [good designs] for our lives!

*   **_professionalism+consumerism_**: yes, we experience negative side effects of that lobby called professionalism: In current mainstream we see so intensive push to prefer only those products over “simple personal production abilities” that after all no-one thinks that could be able to compete against “other producers” and certificating supervisors. This generates on the opposite side unlike resignation: consumerism: People mostly feels as consumers-only: they tends to think that only usable equipments are those bought. - We evaluate such posture critically: it is psychological disease similar to addiction. In contrast to that we at us tries to learn that most of things around us we can perceive as SFG (intermediate personal products).

3 (mainstream-mindset) “**_only-means_**” for happy future of individual-and-family

*   Mainstream often argues that only means for having happy (safe) future - reached by high-income - are:

1.  be high _manager_ for masses: mainstream people usually maps this to _career_: gain “position” - gain “responsibility” - gain “power”. We do not accept this model, simply because not-all can be manager for others: we are social, sorry...
2.  be deep _specialist_: some people don’t want to be slavers; and they have such a luck, that they can use theirs exceptional “geniality” to be “rare” and they become _consultants_. We accept this _career_, we propagate this, and we try to support this by our education-enablings with hope more people will go to enjoy this. -- In mainstream society is this path highly difficult to reach: hierarchies makes it difficult artificially and absurdly from our point of view. Main point of our implementation is that deep specialism is not bond to need of startup & continuation money investments. -- See [career paths ***].
3.  be _capitalist_: this way is obvious: be owner of workers and/or remitters. This is against [right for equal opportunities] from our point of view.

#### cultural fights {#cultural-fights}

*   every co-house defines 'client-zone' which is at best red-zone, but of course can be any other zone. For example blue zone for people in therapy.
*   behind this zone, there is internal one, which cares workers and internal-visitors.

Co-house culture and co-house facilities are cared by co-house holder. S/he defines what to wear, what to consume, and what to do where. In case of conflicts s/he has to formulate it in terms of written 'co-house definition'.

*   this role cannot be holded longer than 5 months; and cannot be returned back to you earlier than after 5 months.
*   this means that you can hold the co-house/culture maximally 3-times: 5+5+4 months in your 2 yrs period...

#### we are not.. {#we-are-not}

In our inner term this paragraph would be lose of time, but (unfortunately) in outside word, there is dominance of people with other than clearly constructive-and-compassionate (red) intents; so we should distance from theirs labels:

*   **_we are not against “consumption”_**: we consume, and we consume a lot. But - we do not misuse others for have our consumption “exotically large”.
*   **_we are not against “reachness”_**: when company is reach, it's stakeholders are reach effectively too. And when our company is stated to be big.
*   **_we are not against “big companies”_**: but we are against “corporations”: we accept and like big _cooperatives - with transparent stock-and-knowhow_. We also provide friendly space to fan-clubs of people which are against big companies actually: if they accept our transparency condition… - see [small is nice]
*   **_we are not against “certified quality”_ **of services: this is completely independent intention then _professionalism_ - which is mainly concurrency-fights mean. At us, we gain certified quality transparently and for free!
*   **_we are not against “vajrayana fans”, meat-eaters, christians, sufites, newage,..._** _and so on_: We are not any kind of church: from outside perspective we are like cluster of villages in close partnership - that’s all. We like to provide friendly space for people with all kinds of _metaphysic_ modelings. We are pro-life oriented. -- Something like “Economy-oriented URI CCs”: We welcome those all - if they accept our non-violence and transparency conditions - our system… - see whole [diversity training]
*   almost stupid to mention such matter of course, but **_we are not here doing or evangelizing “universal solution for all”_**: our solution is here only and only for those with similar taste and for those willing to follow our strictly specialized criterias. Is it clear?

As we stated that we are not “universal solution”, already from that moment it should be clear, that we are not “communists”. But it will be good to conture all varieties of differences:

*   our solution is here only and only for those with serious interest. We are not here for those who are not interested to go our way; and even we are not **_going to fight against_ **them to dominate them; nor our goal is anyhow correlating to wish on harming them.
*   communists (in mainstream sense) were never propagating people’s (material) equanimity: classes fight were from beginning understood as fight of class grasping power _above_ of those who goes to be _under_ (all non-communists). They used **_social-levels_ **and very differentiated _own property_ after all too. Our goal is complete (material) equanimity including such regulation which effectively disables to grasp the power anyhow.
*   communists (in mainstream sense) were never for **_complete transparency_**. They were fundamentally based on secrecy which is inseparable part of psychology of war. We are doing here in complete transparency. -- You already know it.
*   communists (in mainstream sense) were never **_against violence_**. It is clear. Violence is deeply prevented in all different levels of our processes. If you don’t believe, come and see.
*   communists (in mainstream sense) were always **_against religions_**. We so far are trying any possible means to have religious people in our community: as far as they like to be friendly to others and as far as they like to be non-violent in houses of theirs dominance. We believe and we see that this is possible, even when you do not see it in your daily live.
*   communists (in mainstream sense) were at some point talking about annulment of private-property. We always counted with this mean (even when in form equal to all).When communists though about saving of basic people need, they told about **_“flat” and “work”: we from definition cannot go to such big oversimplification_**: Actually they named it like that to justify themselves: they generated “working [only] class” just for themselves. We will always think and talk about “basic living needs” (which include beside living-cell also garden and family/community) and about “work periods” (which primarily must be healthy and cultivated, not dirty-labourer leveled).

Let’s summarize here yet list of concepts which we are programmatically trying to overcome:

1.  we try to live without **_violence, lies, and imperialism_**. Without explanation it is really hard to imagine anything concrete behind such saying. - So please, see [3E training]. For most important implications in daily let’s name:

*   we try to live without any **_competitioning_ **like those at **_markets_** or at **_arenas_**. [See our markets Qs]
*   we try to live without **_undocumented businesses_**. [See our KB]
*   we try to live without **_bigger private properties_** than that _‘for minimal insurance of good personal comfort_’ -- [personal kit]

1.  we try to live without **_money_**. Even when we still agree with statement that money are very effective _enumeration_: of business values and (generally available) resources values.
2.  2<sup>nd</sup> level of 3E is this:

*   we try to live without **_beings-engineering_**: In mainstream, monetization and professionalism together generated very sick situation from our perspective: treating beings by (uncontrolled) machines (including monetized business-machineries): we do not think that this is necessary at all.→ At us, we do not have markets of meat: only personal treatment of animals is allowed at us. [See ***]→ At us, we do not have HR positions: only generally wide performance calculations we maintain: No need of having position to sort it out.
*   we try to live without **_hierarchies without feedback_**: In mainstream, it is usual, that subordinate do not have any (impersonal) feedback onto what higher-up has on him/her. At us we use concept of “Whatever is about me, i have in my dashboard.”
*   we try to overcome **_in-house competitioning_**: → see our [in-house Qs/balancing and cleaning circulations].

1.  we live without **_career-bond livelihood_**: → our livelihood is based on very peaceful eco-living→ our career is based on “pure fun”
2.  we try to live freely without **_art--recording mixture_**: In mainstream, where autonomous recordings are not sellable: where is always someone with interest in profit, there is hardly imaginable to have hope on clean-view:→ At us, we strictly distinguish between raw-recordings: not touched by anyone and those “art-works” - touched media. This is possible by tracking (recording) every-bit of modifying access to data and modifying touching of goods.
3.  we do not use **_loans_**: everything has to be “payed” just in time

*   we know, it is not easy; it has 3 work-outs:

→ many goods and services are done by public-services fans-clubs just for free

→ other goods for personal goals: you have to do by yourself

→ yet bigger goods: you have to fund project-oriented co-house / fans-club

*   see many examples in [green] and [blue] zones

1.  as we stated [at we don’t have paragraph]

*   we do not have driver jobs, we do not have night tech-shifts
*   we do not have shops, nor seller-jobs, nor adverts and it’s makerswe do not have markets - other than workshops

### Cooperations {#cooperations}

*   Yes - we have some suppliers. All of them must be fair trade and bio. We do not require from them to use “work tracking” knowledge sharing.

*   We welcome all intentional communities to join us

*   One of our highest priorities in terms of ***Red Projects***, is to provide and maintain Documentary portal about all kinds of Intentional Communities and about building Humanistic Civilisation.

*   In wider sense, we cooperate with anybody on issues which we share as common: see ***[Netocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netocracy)***.
