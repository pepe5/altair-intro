# Services

*   flag-ship here is:

- **_ALT-plan_** (“Alternativní vzdělávací plán”) includes key points of our live-style, but also points about live which we are explanatory evident by:

*   media-based - heart-touching stories and explenations “how hard” it can goes from particular decisions: eg. loans
*   practically trained courses for most common situations: eg. at hypotheca - extraordinary installments
*   “brown-field” areas: eg. dealing alone with government
*   refer to [[ALT-groups](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19YUbfGfzHHR6cw_ZMvbscYdYSWXk10-JqXkAgEhMwc4/edit)]

This product is key. It propagates our contribution to moving society forward, and at the same time it is available for wide range of clients.

- **_Selling foods_**

*   like lunch delivery service
*   like juices in healthy shops
*   like (Bézovi) in caravans at supermarkets or at festivals
*   in folk markets

- **_Selling woods_**

*   like biomass, or briquettes
*   like toilet paper
*   like crafts, or beams (if we will have saw &| cutter miller)

- **_Selling energy_**

*   like bioethanol
*   like electricity

These 3 named products make us living and stable and at the same time those make us visible to people which are not interested in caring society at all.

- **_Making protected workrooms_**

*   offering part-time positions (see our model - Greyston Bakery) - designed for parents which want / need to be more with theirs families during theirs life-days
*   offering (part-time / [DPP](http://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dohoda_o_proveden%C3%AD_pr%C3%A1ce)) works on non-performance, integration-oriented goods. (See eg. [facebook.com/pages/](https://cs-cz.facebook.com/pages/Elpida/328075435549)[**Elpida**](https://cs-cz.facebook.com/pages/Elpida/328075435549)[/328075435549](https://cs-cz.facebook.com/pages/Elpida/328075435549))

This is how whole our company works. In monitored and controlled amount it can be offered to the public.

- **_Selling other services to people & to government (grand titles)_**

*   requalification trainings in crafts, eco-planting, eco-building, and in IT (unixes, html, ooo, ...)
*   repairing (electric home appliances)
*   tourists accommodation
*   kindergarten (forest style, montessori style)
*   Czech language for foreigners, integrative programs
*   elders care, integration centres, protected workrooms
*   … other grand titles

- **_prices_**

we describe all price policies in [IO chapter] but, let's note here still that generally price is derived from lower market prices. This is because we decided that our live will not hardly rely on monetary income. See ***

#### Principles and IO relations of our services {#principles-and-io-relations-of-our-services}

*   All our services are done by our co-houses
*   Every our co-house is in definition place occupied by “fans of the co-house purpose and culture”.
*   Every co-house has “public-zone”: for clients + theirs’ visitors, and “internal-zone” for members and internal-visitors.
*   We do not produce - and thus we do not have anything for consumption what do not have enough fans: maintainers, researchers, suppliers, and other supporters.- Having something means (in our company) to be fan of that: to contribute to its production. (No monetarized abstracting anonymity.)
*   Products and services are in daily production amount going up and done: by amount of fans - and its queues.

#### Services from personal consumption perspective {#services-from-personal-consumption-perspective}

*   Beside basic personal life-needs which are carried by “personal kits”, co-house services are here to carry personal self-realization wishes; we get these as “reward” for being part of some co-house (its fans-club).
*   This “part of salary” is _benefits-styled_: benefit payment is realized by (factual) availability of the service to the person. This cannot be saved for future.
*   We principially cannot make any private savings here: we have only _common savings_: which are going to be huge…
*   Factual quality of availability can be claimed: this happens often, and is subject of service quality-tunings and other quality-tunings. (We are quality-oriented company.)

*   We cannot make any personally-special procurement to book services or co-house facilities for own-use. Co-house services are persons-agnostic, all flows are directed on general level by (publicly visible) co-house culture-proclamation and concrete level by (publicly visible) e-queues.
*   When you are leaving co-house fans-club (because of 2yrs obligatory period, because of personal wish to travel, or because of leaving company at all) - you can get nothing with you from the co-house. Every co-house is company-property. (Compensations are settled by different means: see [Leaving].)

#### Services from personal maintaining perspective {#services-from-personal-maintaining-perspective}

*   We can join large co-house, we can join the startup, or we can start new one. But be aware:
*   All co-houses are company property: no co-house even smallest-one is private.
*   Nothing produced in co-house is private: all products are publicly explorable, and available for consumption by e-queues for any client.
*   Every new - as every long-running co-house must meet quality requirements: mainly service availability declarations and practice.
*   [Starting up] is our most important training of high-school.
*   Becoming member of any primary-sector services-network of co-houses -- becoming “basic services maintainer” is key part of middle-school.

### Co-op in “Supported projects” {#co-op-in-supported-projects}

This is list of _projects_ in which we are not involved, but which we propagate during our public interactions.

*   mindfulness in education
*   non-violent communication
*   wide range of sanghas ***
*   wide range of prepers ***

### Service of education for increasing house-economic awareness & self-sustainability on work-markets {#service-of-education-for-increasing-house-economic-awareness-self-sustainability-on-work-markets}

#### 

#### “outcome” awareness {#outcome-awareness}

*   at 1<sup>st</sup> place let’s understand, that our live is not going “because of (monetarized) _outcomes_” (what monetarians modeling tries to suggest), - but that our live is going because we gain and consume our **_live-resources_**
*   in other words, when we arrange our lives such a way that we gain our live-resources only by money-outcome, then we (“**_voluntarily_**”) go to relay all our live healthiness only on way how our money come to us! (“not lucky choice”)- see eg. [Air France executives told the plan involves laying off 2,900 staff](http://news.yahoo.com/protesting-workers-force-air-france-managers-flee-104653299--finance.html) ([CZ](http://ekonomika.idnes.cz/zamestnanci-air-france-napadli-kvuli-propousteni-sve-nadrizene-pw4-/eko-zahranicni.aspx?c=A151005_160916_eko-zahranicni_chrs))
*   [filmsForAction.org/news/on_the_phenomenon_of_bullshit_jobs](http://www.filmsforaction.org/news/on_the_phenomenon_of_bullshit_jobs/)

From introspective perspective: we go to particular “work” because:

*   we need to “**_survive healthily_**” (and conveniently - but in minimalistic way)→ this is what we want to recognize, support, and nourish
*   we “need” to “**_get something extra_**” - just to have fun, to have something nice, or to have some luxury comfort. - this is nothing bad at all; but we have to understand that this never can be reason to lose health, or even to be violent (in referred ways: slaveries, fights, and corruptions).→ this (good understanding) is what we want to support;
*   and unfortunately there is 3<sup>rd</sup> “need” - “**_dictated wealth_**”: when resource/service is not what we “need” in sense of healthy survival, nor it is what we personally “want”, but still we percept something like “need” - then this definitely comes from outside: from society.→ we are strongly against this: and we spend quite a lot of time in training to transform originators of such pushings and to become immune against them.

#### income awareness {#income-awareness}

Money-income can be gained by:

*   exchange of your work in employee position - lack of relation to own client → whole live rely on employer
*   exchange of your work with our _direct clients_ - lack of own capital→ live rely on clients
*   exchange of _products of own capital_ with clients→ rely on capital conditioning and on “some amount” of clients too
*   money generated in “abstract markets”

Ad money generated in “abstract markets”:

*   money coming from internet-shops stock-shares
*   money coming from work & stock-shares in “money exchange” markets
*   money coming from “simple” ownership: like real estates, factories, patents, ..

People are enslaved visibly during situations where some near-kin or even dear-friend is asking about someone’s income: we feel tension and maybe even we will not tell it. But (introspectively) why? Does it hurt? Or would we say that some other serious reason could ever exist.

If we don’t want to be slaves, let’s talk clearly and profoundly about that: Our economic situation could be described by 6-8 numbers (or 6-8 series of numbers):

1.  our past sum of **_activas_ **till present of the house / faimly
2.  our past sum of **_pasivas_ **till present of the house / faimly
3.  our current **_income_ **of the house / faimly
4.  our current **_outcome_** of the house / faimly
5.  calculating together our current/expected income-outcome with all expected passiva-activa operations → enumerate sum of forecasted **_activas_ **after 10-20 years
6.  calculating together our current/expected income-outcome with all expected passiva-activa operations → enumerate sum of forecasted **_pasivas_** after 10-20 years
7.  calculating together our current/expected income-outcome with all expected passiva-activa operations → enumerate sum of forecasted _activas_ at **point of retirement**. This and next number incorporates comparatively your age.
8.  calculating together our current/expected income-outcome with all expected passiva-activa operations → enumerate sum of forecasted _pasivas_ at point of retirement.

-- Let’s calculate it and compare together. --

#### corporations awareness {#corporations-awareness}

+ Let’s calculate it in hypothetical case -

*   where we can put our hands on where our taxes goes
*   where we are not enslaved by loans. (Liberation enabled by co-housing sharing.)
*   where we can easily choose partial jobs enabling us join work position with parental role, study positions with career and partner roles, ...

-- We will clearly see that corporations have _milions-sized_ impact on us.

#### consumption awareness {#consumption-awareness}

How price of a good increases: (Bad for clients)

*   Workers men-days -- salaries cost per 1 item
*   Technologies occupied -- materials, machines, transport, & sheds per 1 item-- these were factors for _production price_, but we are paying something else: _selling price_ of the good: so lets add some more factors:(Good for holders:)
*   Promotions cost -- per 1 item
*   and Payments to owners, & thiers managers, & government taxes -- this is definitively about half+ of the selling price. None of these can be called really-producing “workers”!

How price consolidates: (Bad for clients and workers:)

*   Worker salaries decrease -- causes damage on welfare and the item quality
*   Technologies consolidation -- causes on quality (mainly in securing engineering) should be publicised
*   Promotional and all owners payments i will not name here -- this event actually doesn’t happen
*   Governmental grants -- makes people too dependent on governing holders and distorts local sustainabilities
*   Private grants -- todays called “discounts”. Be sure that private subjects are going to get all moneys back after breaking down local concurrency

What contributes to quality per cost: how to choose the good/producer and what to do more:

*   choosing local products decreases transport prices
*   choosing small companies decreases number of managers per item
*   choosing transparent and welfare increases overall quality -- which we are definitely interested in
*   choosing [Good design] is way for the Quality for sure

#### good design awareness {#good-design-awareness}

*   things are modular
*   things have open-sourced designs
*   things have open forums about usage and maintenance
*   things are local-technologies oriented
*   things are autonomously maintained
*   things are high-availability clustered

Designs of _public media production_: is not perceived as “bad” by mainstream yet. This unfortunately is a sign of slavery well-done. But let’s name main problems in contrast of quality solutions and things will become cleaner: You can judge “_how your taxes are spent_” in global medias:

*   **_public “news”_**
*   we need to see _in advance_ what was voted and decided; not after the event
*   we need to see how non-profiting specialists judge the matter; not profiting ones
*   **_“advertisments”_**
*   we need to see how real users evaluates the good, not what the producer thinks
*   we need to know _who_ will be payed in reality after selling the item; not entertainments of low-forces of clients

*   **_“authenticity”_**
*   we are not in need to have just _good-impression_ but rather we are in strong need to know what is raw photograph or otherwise what is refactored imaginary.
*   in our terms: we need to have access to not-refactored records about (art-making) “recording”.

We all know, that hi-tech facilities took significant amount of resources to be made of.

*   the more advanced technology we want to use - the more people should share it to spread the costs
*   good sharing is one of most important aspect of good-design. We share by organizing:
*   place - IE.: How to touch and interact in more people.
*   time - IE.: How to gain access in time-line.
*   maintenance - IE.: How to spread costs on sustainability and recycling
*   risks - IE.: How to deal with responsibility

It will be discussed yet in [Green zone ***], but let’s make small sum-up:

1.  what we need daily: must be available in 10’minutes far from your personal-tent→ you have to work @ your co-house
2.  what we need monthly: must be available in 30’minutes far from your personal-tent
3.  what we need yearly: must be available in 2hrs far from your personal-tent

### markets - ie. understanding of good markets-design {#markets-ie-understanding-of-good-markets-design}

good design of environment which delivers a facility to client includes:

*   autonomous delivery (as much as possible)
*   autonomous construction (as much as possible)
*   autonomous collecting of sub-contributions
*   detail monitoring and tracking back in time
*   hi availability of construction resources (through redundancy and through diversity)

#### mainstream market types {#mainstream-market-types}

Let's distinguish markets of products from end-**_consumer_**’s perspective. This is how we are oriented: important is end-man: inhabitant of house. So this man has to physically move forward to attain the piece - so markets from this perspective are:

*   **_markets at houses_**: ie. when seller comes with the good directly to consumer’s house
*   **_markets on streets_**: ie. at places out of houses; but still not owned by sellers
*   **_markets at plazzas_**: ie. at places not-suitable for living; not owned by consumers living there, but owned by sellers: from consumer perspective. (These places are manifestation of power above consumer: because s/he is forced beside paying yet spent time and traveling effort to gain the payed good: imagine mothers with children traveling for daily goods...)
*   **_markets not-for-him/her_**: markets dealing goods to other “clients”: processing companies and “reselling” companies. (These places are manifestation of yet bigger power above consumer, because it shows that companies can eat yet bigger portion of selling price of the good.)

Implications from this structuring ***

In short this (common mainstream) markets are based on pretending faked “hello effect” qualities of the goods. Client in general searches for goods _with wanted qualities_, and only because no other than “hello effect” -- artificial qualities are available in “normal” markets, s/he feel as “looking for” the good; but in fact s/he relies on very badly descriptive offerings!

*   usually only price is available as real-quality of the good; but even this in some cases is hidden (as example in house-constructions offerings)
*   then there is almost unavailable list of components: in food-production it is dictated by law to publicize components, but in comparison with our way, it is so poor that we would say it is not offered at all
*   instead of usage evaluations mainstream markets are playing on “trademarks”: essentially artificial “good quality”: we do not push client to orientate by such stupid “last resort” orientation quality→ we use usage-evaluations connected with the good implicitly
*   usage technology-limits: in some branches it is directed by law (like electricity), in some branches there are manuals available with the good. -- It is too late for client to have it after deal is made, isn’t it?
*   and as last in mainstream markets there are emotions-based qualities: advertisements - we do not allow advertisements in common sense at all. We have very strict and very detailed regulations on this. Instead of that we use “users-posts”: everyone who wants to make this video-comment on the good, has to be real user: and it is publicly tracked in which period s/he was as such - and video becomes “archive” when s/he goes off from the usage

It is good to be also aware about fact that mainstream markets are ‘good’ too:

*   They are designed perfectly to serve just its purpose… - to provide every possible advantage for a seller over the clients and/or competitors. The problem is ‘only’ that interests other than this one are not included.
*   There is nothing like free-market in the mainstream world at all. It is not possible to play anything like that without complete transparency. See all laws about ‘spiritual properties’, about cartels, about public-healthiness limits, about Monsanto, Shell and co.

#### our designs {#our-designs}

*   public facilities- available just at your place -- by not-owned sheds
*   “expensive” facilities- you have to change flat for them

Our way and goal is

*   to maximize amount and technology-level of public facilities available for all our membersThis means production for “Queue” -- for unknown consumer. And it means to transport the facilities right to them.→ our factories do not fight for consumers: they try to reach the queue
*   our factories has very different look & feel in comparison to mainstream, where they are artificially specialized to products strictly usable to seller favorite markets: in other words in mainstream factory, products do not have widely sensible value, and due to that workers has this strictly limited value too→ our factories are ran by its’ workers - just for “fun” (more precisely “just for fans”): factory will be ran in long-term only if its workers feel sympathy / inclination to the products / its IO-chains. In other words most of our factories are very “complete”: they are full of small machines reaching end-user completeness as much as possible.
