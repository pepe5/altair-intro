# Red zone, impressions about to come and to leave {#red-zone-impressions-about-to-come-and-to-leave}

-- is interface to outside world. (We look from outside red colored.)

*   main purpose of red zone is to protect our employees - ie. our stockholders.
*   we mainly protect theirs privacy, theirs interests, and theirs property at all.

### 1st pros and cons counting about our company {#1st-pros-and-cons-counting-about-our-company}

*   we have quite minimalistic private facilities - and equal to all
*   - but we don’t have any loans
*   we do not have full-time specializations
*   - but we have enormous amount of training means for part-time specializations
*   we do not allow creativity and competitions -based job careers
*   - but we require quite big part of working time to be spent by creativity

*   if you like our attempt of human-live support - you are welcome
*   - but you have to accept our requirements
*   is most known, that we are “big brothers” (we record: 1/non-private activities, 2/resources use, & 3/biometrics),
*   - but we -all- brothers & sisters are here and willing to (literally) push out - everyone who feels need to be free from this. (S/he has to understand, that we also want to have him/her to be free from us - if s/he wants so.)

*   3 biggest “outside” visible motivations for coming would be 1/ life (quite reach mainly from social perspective) without loans 2/ knowledge sharing (mainly useful for becoming qualified for some crafting), and 3/ stunning travelling (enabling ones to travel with whole family for safe and convenient work anywhere: This is incredibly useful in today's era of enormous migration connected with discrediting long-term travelers name)
*   1 of strongest motivation to give “privates from previous era” to Company could be to enable company to accommodate own kins. But this is not allowed for new-comers. Conservation period is about 4-8 yrs. For this -quite long- transitional period, brown zone is used.

*   We say that: “we _refuse to feed ourselves by business_: because monetized abstraction abstracted us away from our basic right: to be vitally inter-connected with health primary-source: carrying garden and grow in garden.”
*   We believe that healthy lifestyle and happy live-carrying is distorted by performance striving / competing, so it can be achieved and lived without it much easily and more sustainably.

Imagine this: you want to know how to grow beans, apples, ginger, …; how to maintain saw-mill, wind power-plant, steam-cutter; how to conserve plants, weave flax, melt steel, craft glass tools, assemble engine; setup distributed storage, video conferencing, measuring biometrics; …

*   at us you can learn it all - for free
*   only condition is that all what you learn (uncommon) at us, or invent at us - will stay here, or under non-for-profit license

So after all, we can say best-fitting motivation for working with us is -

*   **_to unite to have good ideas about livelihood and society realized_**
*   we see that almost every low-motivations oriented man can co-op with others (even incompatible mate from larger perspective), and people with very similar higher-motivations still goes alone: this is effective root-cause of “bad situation in the world”
*   we are not for elite-oriented seekers. We are targeting mainly average performers with non-violent lifestyle and vision.

### Stress-free living {#stress-free-living}

Basically in mainstream society, you can distinguish between 5 different kind of “works”:

1.  “work” which is **fundamentally stressful**: races, killing or enslaving people, hazards, slaveries itself like for sex or drogs, … These are usually argued by formulations like this: “_if you don’t want to be beaten, if you want survive - then do these all harming things_”.
2.  “work” which could be done (theoretically) without stress, but organization of that activity is designed to have it **stressful by effectiveness pressure**: Stress is still fundamentally bounded to the position, because to work exceptionally and to be irreplaceable is stressful. These are mainly all “highly qualified” positions, like: programing, “emergency” management, slavery labourers mainly in factories, in health-care, & in companies competitions, … These are usually argued by formulations like this: “_if you want to success, then do this_”.
3.  “work” which could be done (theoretically) without stress, but organization of that activity is designed to have it **stressful by destructing employment rights**: These are all those “unqualified labourers” like: in building constructions, transport services, in factories, in health-care, … These are usually argued by formulations like this: “_if you don’t want to be replaced by some other waiting navvy, then do this_”.
4.  “work” which are basically stress-free, but in reality for many people is unfortunately stressful, because they fell to money income:outcome limit or to timing limits due to family or healthiness need. This kind of “work” is still cause of stress - because **in “work” market - there is not adequate better choice**. This is mainly pointing to lack of part-time positions, requalifications, too long commutations to “good work”, inability to moderate work timing with care of children, elders, and self.
5.  “work” which is happily experienced as stress-free: mainly because workers are enough qualified and reach to take chance to move and mitigate freely.

Workers are artificially and intentionally stressed by:

*   artificial timing
*   artificial consequences on quality performance: to place to which work is positioned is artificially too fragile: by both too unreliable tooling and non-redundant place-occupation
*   restrictions on sharing: both general and actual knowledge are artificially barriered out
*   social - black-sheep practices are practiced in collectives

What is _many troubles cause_ here - is not difference between these kinds of works, but “_work_” - the term itself:

*   you can claim that we used term “work” for activities which are included in term “job” only: Yes, all 4 named stressful works are actually stressful jobs: employments, or self-owned businesses. We used only “**_works for money_**” in our listing. We are usually persuaded by somebody that we hardly rely in life on it. -- And this is root-cause of stress.
*   we have to go to recognize that we actually work (on our lives), but actually not for money: we _can_ work on real life-resources.
*   the _work (the term)_: is yet more complicated by demagogy of _professionalism_ - where fight of knowledge-holders and projects-oriented paradigm penetrates everything: the same way as in shallow media demagogy the _monetization_ is sacrificed to be above human health. So here in our company, we strictly distinguishes between “basic work” (3hrs-period) which must be easy, relaxing, healthy, peaceful, and “timing-free” [*** see DAY INTRO]; and other “fun activities” (relaxation, creativity, & career periods) which are strictly highly voluntary.

### Problems of mainstream which are handled forward by our implementation {#problems-of-mainstream-which-are-handled-forward-by-our-implementation}

*   **_slavery relationships_**, direct pushings to slavery relationships, and sophisticated indirect organizational treatments which ends up in slavery relationships after all.- Please get in touch with modern slavery suffering at [***].
*   **_concurrency fights_ **for work positions, for living resources, for power in co-houses, for power in fan-clubs, concurrency attitude to nearby men which is going against friendship and openness. We are against any hiding!- Please get in touch with concurrency fights suffering at [***].
*   **_fails in treating children_ **at both family and nursery areas. Also any misunderstandings in consecutive analysis. We protect parents and all relatives in theirs right to be together if they all wish even if they are not 'the best' in some situations or roles. Protectors and coaches will assist in asking man every moment. - Please get in touch with fails in treating children suffering at [***].
*   **_monetary forces_**: we do not need loans, we do not need to buy basic things a even most of resources of comfort are available very easily. We do not need to sell our health, our family time, nor our ethic. - Please get in touch with monetary forces suffering at [***].
*   **_imperialism hierarchies_**: we have very limited, very flat, and always transparent hierarchies. No possibility to catch power through generation, no possibility to catch power longer than 2 years. - Please get in touch with imperialism hierarchies suffering at [***].
*   **_cultural fights_**: culture is realized on level of co-houses. Culture holders cannot extend this power over borders of the co-house, over 2 years period, and the power is conditioned by 'prosperity' of co-house facilities. - Can be withdrawn due to public or auditing evaluation.- Please get in touch with cultural fights suffering at [***].

### Entering process {#entering-process}

#### Highest priorities identification and labor contract {#highest-priorities-identification-and-labor-contract}

Our highest priorities are:

1.  **_Sharing know-how_**: we sign, propagate, and live experience of having video-shared + text-digitalized _all work-time_ is not harmful in area of practiced non-violence, but in opposite: it is very joyful, enriching, and self-confident bringing way of living.
2.  **_Feeding and realizing self healthily_**: we live and we commit to live it during whole our membership period - to feed and realize self healthily: living day periods in good bio-rhythm, being self-sustainable on basic level, rejecting any 'offering' of enslaving relations, sharing asked details truthfully, caring space peacefully, and influencing others with will to contribute to theirs own self-acceptance and inner-peace.
3.  Organizationally **_relating self to others_** always only **_in non-imperialistic role_**: We understand it this way: we step into organizational relation with someone only iff we have enough evidences that this person steps into it in purely-tasteful - unstressed and fully informed posture, and iff we have enough evidences about that s/he is able to leave this relationship easily.

- you can see that these are [3E]

--> you will receive training about it during this entering process.

These 3 priorities are our charter: all our companies share these 3 and theirs (3E) training in exactly the same form.

Here is [labor contract]:

*   it is public document, there is public (moderated) discussion on that
*   We maintain [123 currently active versions] of that by 123 independent companies - every our company has theirs (public) version same for all it's members.

--> we will go through that together, and will try to discuss every important topic from it's forum-portal.

#### Description of works frame: {#description-of-works-frame}

*   everyone has right to work healthily - without mess-stress, loans, and over-times
*   everyone has right to be materially ensured - by himself:everyone has right for- and has to- work for it in **_“primary sector”_**:

1.  farming - Caring of plants, animals, and food.
2.  housing - Caring of house, rooms, and primary machines, and toolings.
3.  socializing - Caring of family, and friends and -health-caring - Caring of physical and spiritual healthiness.

*   everyone has enough of **_“primary toolings”_**: Those are:
    1.  farming tools
    2.  kitchen tools
    3.  children-care & health-care tools
    4.  personal IT tools
*   you can be part-timer: 2hrs a day you can have own business (the monetized one)
    1.  in red-zone (in meaning you deal with company identity during your own business somehow): this is with fixed-term & work-tasks contracts only
    2.  in brown-zone - most common personal-business solution: In fact, we are encouraged to have this for months of [leaving-drills]. You need to have accounting at us if you want not to become external-supplier.
    3.  in other zones (except white one of course): to have own business in other than brown-zone means, everything is recorded: such case is acceptable for us, because it contributes to our KB

#### Introductory description of materials & services inter-dependencies: {#introductory-description-of-materials-services-inter-dependencies}

*   everyone has right to be “socially satisfied - by free-society services:***

#### Description of legal and economical conditions of entering and leaving {#description-of-legal-and-economical-conditions-of-entering-and-leaving}

When you are entering, you go to contribute amount of property which can be higher or lower than actual evaluation of [_personal-kit_] _+_ [_personal-field_].

1.  when your contribution is higher than personal kit+field: you get this kit+field and agreement that: you will receive back contribution equivalent and:
    *   if company will profit during that period, then yet + interest based on national ratios or on company-wide ratios if those are higher.
    *   if company will not profit enough, you will receive back: amount equal to portion of all-holders share -- if this is higher than kit+field
    *   if company will not profit at all, you will get with you your kit+field still.
2.  when your contribution is lower than kit+field current evaluation: you will enter for temporal period to [_brown zone_] where you will be paid by monetized salary until it will sum up to kit+field evaluation. -- You become our regular subcontractor, where
    *   you can choose any of [_orange zone_] for living: which will be comfortable and satisfying for you, but mainly will enable you to save practically all your income. (This can be viewed as analogy of “_novices_” state in monastic organization of living: it enables you to enjoy being part of community and services in phase where you were still not able to fulfill membership conditions fully.)
    *   Or you can still postpone yourself in brown zone itself - if your outside income is bigger than what we pay to subcontractors; and you store it in our account dedicated for your entrance preparation.

By acquiring the membership here, you receive the ownership of all-equal fraction of company property, but let's say it clear:

*   This fraction is conditioned by pre-emption agreement towards the company, and it will be always used; so this fraction cannot be monetized actually.
*   No one, nor you, can have other than equal portion of the stock. No one can become major holder with major influence on stocks flow.

When you are entering, you agree with that you will be paid out by land + money - which do not relate with kind of property you contributed. You can choose land location and monies currency. Your entering property is assembled into services of our society already.

Most are valuated contributions of:

*   *   factories, and its design, then… -
    *   machines, and its design,
    *   patents and copyrights,
    *   lands, and high-quality plant seeds,
    *   chemicals and receipts -- in health-care, food, heavy and light industry.

-- in other words, money and properties not useful for the company are kind of provisory solution.

Already during entering it is required to be well trained in area of leaving:

*   You were already informed what you are going to take with you from your entering investment: can you name it? [Here] it is referred in contract.
*   We will go through and discuss your back-doors preparation.
*   See [Leaving] section for details on leaving process.

#### Be prepared - we don’t have… {#be-prepared-we-don-t-have}

Even before going to any training/drill, we would like to make you prepared to some “harder” differences in comparison to mainstream:

*   members do not own houses, they have to move each 2nd year
*   we do not have a driver jobs (work has to be done @ your co-house)we do not have night tech-shifts
*   we do not have shops - deals are done in public websites but we extensively use showrooms
*   see also [we are not]

#### Obligatory entrance trainings {#obligatory-entrance-trainings}

*   **3**ε / **_3MTs_**
*   **_labeling-diversity training_**
*   basic-school **_3-periods_ **trainings
*   **_indicators drill_**: we have some values and we have detailed KB of _contra-indicators_ which helps us detect social situations and personal postures which can be destructive against it: we have for example do not say here at this community: “_i hate it here_” or “_this is fucking difficult here_” or “_i feel as a slave_” or “_i do not have here what i want_” and other self-expressionings. If someone goes to do that at alone, s/he is entering blue-state by that. If someone goes to do that at situation with other people, s/he directs him/her self towards the process of leaving by us that.
*   ***

-- See more in [dedicated chapters].

What to expect and what you are going to be asked for - is described in particular sections, but let's count briefly:

*   When you are going somewhere here where you are going to be asked to do something new to you

--> you will always get chance to practice coming requirements in detail before being requested for it.

- you cannot be penalized for anything what you didn't receive public detailed training for.

*   Whole our educational and certifying system is based on (recorded) practice of whole check-list; no one can test you from anything where s/he do not have evidence you practiced.
*   You cannot be penalized for anything if you didn't receive warning about that and offering of training and guidance.
*   There is nothing what can be obligated to do in terms of active duty without possibility to simply leave that place -

- except [violin zone].

### Leaving {#leaving}

*   you can be directed to leave if you don’t want to accept our rules “for all” or if you do not follow it. But of course, you will be guided and protected by our [_protectors_] to orientate in ways how to save your membership ***
*   you are immediately asked to leave if you will express feeling that our organization has _too big power_ above you. (We requires much because we offers much.) You have to leave if you feel this. We protect both sides from useless discussions on that.
