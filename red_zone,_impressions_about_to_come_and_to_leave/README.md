# Red zone, impressions about to come and to leave {#red-zone-impressions-about-to-come-and-to-leave}

-- is interface to outside world. (We look from outside red colored.)

*   main purpose of red zone is to protect our employees - ie. our stockholders.
*   we mainly protect theirs privacy, theirs interests, and theirs property at all.

### 1st pros and cons counting about our company {#1st-pros-and-cons-counting-about-our-company}

*   we have quite minimalistic private facilities - and equal to all
*   - but we don’t have any loans
*   we do not have full-time specializations
*   - but we have enormous amount of training means for part-time specializations
*   we do not allow creativity and competitions -based job careers
*   - but we require quite big part of working time to be spent by creativity

*   if you like our attempt of human-live support - you are welcome
*   - but you have to accept our requirements
*   is most known, that we are “big brothers” (we record: 1/non-private activities, 2/resources use, & 3/biometrics),
*   - but we -all- brothers & sisters are here and willing to (literally) push out - everyone who feels need to be free from this. (S/he has to understand, that we also want to have him/her to be free from us - if s/he wants so.)

*   3 biggest “outside” visible motivations for coming would be 1/ life (quite reach mainly from social perspective) without loans 2/ knowledge sharing (mainly useful for becoming qualified for some crafting), and 3/ stunning travelling (enabling ones to travel with whole family for safe and convenient work anywhere: This is incredibly useful in today's era of enormous migration connected with discrediting long-term travelers name)
*   1 of strongest motivation to give “privates from previous era” to Company could be to enable company to accommodate own kins. But this is not allowed for new-comers. Conservation period is about 4-8 yrs. For this -quite long- transitional period, brown zone is used.

*   We say that: “we _refuse to feed ourselves by business_: because monetized abstraction abstracted us away from our basic right: to be vitally inter-connected with health primary-source: carrying garden and grow in garden.”
*   We believe that healthy lifestyle and happy live-carrying is distorted by performance striving / competing, so it can be achieved and lived without it much easily and more sustainably.

Imagine this: you want to know how to grow beans, apples, ginger, …; how to maintain saw-mill, wind power-plant, steam-cutter; how to conserve plants, weave flax, melt steel, craft glass tools, assemble engine; setup distributed storage, video conferencing, measuring biometrics; …

*   at us you can learn it all - for free
*   only condition is that all what you learn (uncommon) at us, or invent at us - will stay here, or under non-for-profit license

So after all, we can say best-fitting motivation for working with us is -

*   **_to unite to have good ideas about livelihood and society realized_**
*   we see that almost every low-motivations oriented man can co-op with others (even incompatible mate from larger perspective), and people with very similar higher-motivations still goes alone: this is effective root-cause of “bad situation in the world”
*   we are not for elite-oriented seekers. We are targeting mainly average performers with non-violent lifestyle and vision.

### Stress-free living {#stress-free-living}

Basically in mainstream society, you can distinguish between 5 different kind of “works”:

1.  “work” which is **fundamentally stressful**: races, killing or enslaving people, hazards, slaveries itself like for sex or drogs, … These are usually argued by formulations like this: “_if you don’t want to be beaten, if you want survive - then do these all harming things_”.
2.  “work” which could be done (theoretically) without stress, but organization of that activity is designed to have it **stressful by effectiveness pressure**: Stress is still fundamentally bounded to the position, because to work exceptionally and to be irreplaceable is stressful. These are mainly all “highly qualified” positions, like: programing, “emergency” management, slavery labourers mainly in factories, in health-care, & in companies competitions, … These are usually argued by formulations like this: “_if you want to success, then do this_”.
3.  “work” which could be done (theoretically) without stress, but organization of that activity is designed to have it **stressful by destructing employment rights**: These are all those “unqualified labourers” like: in building constructions, transport services, in factories, in health-care, … These are usually argued by formulations like this: “_if you don’t want to be replaced by some other waiting navvy, then do this_”.
4.  “work” which are basically stress-free, but in reality for many people is unfortunately stressful, because they fell to money income:outcome limit or to timing limits due to family or healthiness need. This kind of “work” is still cause of stress - because **in “work” market - there is not adequate better choice**. This is mainly pointing to lack of part-time positions, requalifications, too long commutations to “good work”, inability to moderate work timing with care of children, elders, and self.
5.  “work” which is happily experienced as stress-free: mainly because workers are enough qualified and reach to take chance to move and mitigate freely.

Workers are artificially and intentionally stressed by:

*   artificial timing
*   artificial consequences on quality performance: to place to which work is positioned is artificially too fragile: by both too unreliable tooling and non-redundant place-occupation
*   restrictions on sharing: both general and actual knowledge are artificially barriered out
*   social - black-sheep practices are practiced in collectives

What is _many troubles cause_ here - is not difference between these kinds of works, but “_work_” - the term itself:

*   you can claim that we used term “work” for activities which are included in term “job” only: Yes, all 4 named stressful works are actually stressful jobs: employments, or self-owned businesses. We used only “**_works for money_**” in our listing. We are usually persuaded by somebody that we hardly rely in life on it. -- And this is root-cause of stress.
*   we have to go to recognize that we actually work (on our lives), but actually not for money: we _can_ work on real life-resources.
*   the _work (the term)_: is yet more complicated by demagogy of _professionalism_ - where fight of knowledge-holders and projects-oriented paradigm penetrates everything: the same way as in shallow media demagogy the _monetization_ is sacrificed to be above human health. So here in our company, we strictly distinguishes between “basic work” (3hrs-period) which must be easy, relaxing, healthy, peaceful, and “timing-free” [*** see DAY INTRO]; and other “fun activities” (relaxation, creativity, & career periods) which are strictly highly voluntary.

### Problems of mainstream which are handled forward by our implementation {#problems-of-mainstream-which-are-handled-forward-by-our-implementation}

*   **_slavery relationships_**, direct pushings to slavery relationships, and sophisticated indirect organizational treatments which ends up in slavery relationships after all.- Please get in touch with modern slavery suffering at [***].
*   **_concurrency fights_ **for work positions, for living resources, for power in co-houses, for power in fan-clubs, concurrency attitude to nearby men which is going against friendship and openness. We are against any hiding!- Please get in touch with concurrency fights suffering at [***].
*   **_fails in treating children_ **at both family and nursery areas. Also any misunderstandings in consecutive analysis. We protect parents and all relatives in theirs right to be together if they all wish even if they are not 'the best' in some situations or roles. Protectors and coaches will assist in asking man every moment. - Please get in touch with fails in treating children suffering at [***].
*   **_monetary forces_**: we do not need loans, we do not need to buy basic things a even most of resources of comfort are available very easily. We do not need to sell our health, our family time, nor our ethic. - Please get in touch with monetary forces suffering at [***].
*   **_imperialism hierarchies_**: we have very limited, very flat, and always transparent hierarchies. No possibility to catch power through generation, no possibility to catch power longer than 2 years. - Please get in touch with imperialism hierarchies suffering at [***].
*   **_cultural fights_**: culture is realized on level of co-houses. Culture holders cannot extend this power over borders of the co-house, over 2 years period, and the power is conditioned by 'prosperity' of co-house facilities. - Can be withdrawn due to public or auditing evaluation.- Please get in touch with cultural fights suffering at [***].

### Entering process {#entering-process}

#### Highest priorities identification and labor contract {#highest-priorities-identification-and-labor-contract}

Our highest priorities are:

1.  **_Sharing know-how_**: we sign, propagate, and live experience of having video-shared + text-digitalized _all work-time_ is not harmful in area of practiced non-violence, but in opposite: it is very joyful, enriching, and self-confident bringing way of living.
2.  **_Feeding and realizing self healthily_**: we live and we commit to live it during whole our membership period - to feed and realize self healthily: living day periods in good bio-rhythm, being self-sustainable on basic level, rejecting any 'offering' of enslaving relations, sharing asked details truthfully, caring space peacefully, and influencing others with will to contribute to theirs own self-acceptance and inner-peace.
3.  Organizationally **_relating self to others_** always only **_in non-imperialistic role_**: We understand it this way: we step into organizational relation with someone only iff we have enough evidences that this person steps into it in purely-tasteful - unstressed and fully informed posture, and iff we have enough evidences about that s/he is able to leave this relationship easily.

- you can see that these are [3E]

--> you will receive training about it during this entering process.

These 3 priorities are our charter: all our companies share these 3 and theirs (3E) training in exactly the same form.

Here is [labor contract]:

*   it is public document, there is public (moderated) discussion on that
*   We maintain [123 currently active versions] of that by 123 independent companies - every our company has theirs (public) version same for all it's members.

--> we will go through that together, and will try to discuss every important topic from it's forum-portal.

#### Description of works frame: {#description-of-works-frame}

*   everyone has right to work healthily - without mess-stress, loans, and over-times
*   everyone has right to be materially ensured - by himself:everyone has right for- and has to- work for it in **_“primary sector”_**:

1.  farming - Caring of plants, animals, and food.
2.  housing - Caring of house, rooms, and primary machines, and toolings.
3.  socializing - Caring of family, and friends and -health-caring - Caring of physical and spiritual healthiness.

*   everyone has enough of **_“primary toolings”_**: Those are:
    1.  farming tools
    2.  kitchen tools
    3.  children-care & health-care tools
    4.  personal IT tools
*   you can be part-timer: 2hrs a day you can have own business (the monetized one)
    1.  in red-zone (in meaning you deal with company identity during your own business somehow): this is with fixed-term & work-tasks contracts only
    2.  in brown-zone - most common personal-business solution: In fact, we are encouraged to have this for months of [leaving-drills]. You need to have accounting at us if you want not to become external-supplier.
    3.  in other zones (except white one of course): to have own business in other than brown-zone means, everything is recorded: such case is acceptable for us, because it contributes to our KB

#### Introductory description of materials & services inter-dependencies: {#introductory-description-of-materials-services-inter-dependencies}

*   everyone has right to be “socially satisfied - by free-society services:***

#### Description of legal and economical conditions of entering and leaving {#description-of-legal-and-economical-conditions-of-entering-and-leaving}

When you are entering, you go to contribute amount of property which can be higher or lower than actual evaluation of [_personal-kit_] _+_ [_personal-field_].

1.  when your contribution is higher than personal kit+field: you get this kit+field and agreement that: you will receive back contribution equivalent and:
    *   if company will profit during that period, then yet + interest based on national ratios or on company-wide ratios if those are higher.
    *   if company will not profit enough, you will receive back: amount equal to portion of all-holders share -- if this is higher than kit+field
    *   if company will not profit at all, you will get with you your kit+field still.
2.  when your contribution is lower than kit+field current evaluation: you will enter for temporal period to [_brown zone_] where you will be paid by monetized salary until it will sum up to kit+field evaluation. -- You become our regular subcontractor, where
    *   you can choose any of [_orange zone_] for living: which will be comfortable and satisfying for you, but mainly will enable you to save practically all your income. (This can be viewed as analogy of “_novices_” state in monastic organization of living: it enables you to enjoy being part of community and services in phase where you were still not able to fulfill membership conditions fully.)
    *   Or you can still postpone yourself in brown zone itself - if your outside income is bigger than what we pay to subcontractors; and you store it in our account dedicated for your entrance preparation.

By acquiring the membership here, you receive the ownership of all-equal fraction of company property, but let's say it clear:

*   This fraction is conditioned by pre-emption agreement towards the company, and it will be always used; so this fraction cannot be monetized actually.
*   No one, nor you, can have other than equal portion of the stock. No one can become major holder with major influence on stocks flow.

When you are entering, you agree with that you will be paid out by land + money - which do not relate with kind of property you contributed. You can choose land location and monies currency. Your entering property is assembled into services of our society already.

Most are valuated contributions of:

*   *   factories, and its design, then… -
    *   machines, and its design,
    *   patents and copyrights,
    *   lands, and high-quality plant seeds,
    *   chemicals and receipts -- in health-care, food, heavy and light industry.

-- in other words, money and properties not useful for the company are kind of provisory solution.

Already during entering it is required to be well trained in area of leaving:

*   You were already informed what you are going to take with you from your entering investment: can you name it? [Here] it is referred in contract.
*   We will go through and discuss your back-doors preparation.
*   See [Leaving] section for details on leaving process.

#### Be prepared - we don’t have… {#be-prepared-we-don-t-have}

Even before going to any training/drill, we would like to make you prepared to some “harder” differences in comparison to mainstream:

*   members do not own houses, they have to move each 2nd year
*   we do not have a driver jobs (work has to be done @ your co-house)we do not have night tech-shifts
*   we do not have shops - deals are done in public websites but we extensively use showrooms
*   see also [we are not]

#### Obligatory entrance trainings {#obligatory-entrance-trainings}

*   **3**ε / **_3MTs_**
*   **_labeling-diversity training_**
*   basic-school **_3-periods_ **trainings
*   **_indicators drill_**: we have some values and we have detailed KB of _contra-indicators_ which helps us detect social situations and personal postures which can be destructive against it: we have for example do not say here at this community: “_i hate it here_” or “_this is fucking difficult here_” or “_i feel as a slave_” or “_i do not have here what i want_” and other self-expressionings. If someone goes to do that at alone, s/he is entering blue-state by that. If someone goes to do that at situation with other people, s/he directs him/her self towards the process of leaving by us that.
*   ***

-- See more in [dedicated chapters].

What to expect and what you are going to be asked for - is described in particular sections, but let's count briefly:

*   When you are going somewhere here where you are going to be asked to do something new to you

--> you will always get chance to practice coming requirements in detail before being requested for it.

- you cannot be penalized for anything what you didn't receive public detailed training for.

*   Whole our educational and certifying system is based on (recorded) practice of whole check-list; no one can test you from anything where s/he do not have evidence you practiced.
*   You cannot be penalized for anything if you didn't receive warning about that and offering of training and guidance.
*   There is nothing what can be obligated to do in terms of active duty without possibility to simply leave that place -

- except [violin zone].

### Leaving {#leaving}

*   you can be directed to leave if you don’t want to accept our rules “for all” or if you do not follow it. But of course, you will be guided and protected by our [_protectors_] to orientate in ways how to save your membership ***
*   you are immediately asked to leave if you will express feeling that our organization has _too big power_ above you. (We requires much because we offers much.) You have to leave if you feel this. We protect both sides from useless discussions on that.

### Commentaries on outer structures and outer values {#commentaries-on-outer-structures-and-outer-values}

*   We fully support all tries of implementing non-violence, living without loans, ecologic and voluntarity engagements.
*   We fully support all Local-economics, all tries to live without corporations, all tries on direct democracy and transparency.
*   We fully support all Local-communities -- tries of implementation specific (humanic) values. -- Let’s cooperate!

#### slavery relationships {#slavery-relationships}

*   These are all situations where is no encouragement or guidance how to escape.- We provide guidance about escaping at all possible situations.
*   *** modern slavery ***We are here to stop hiding against what terrible situations our governments and corporations constructs and keep going. Let's name some:
*   all “markets” with guns, slavers, & drugs
*   all legalization of homeless states, personal bankruptcy, household executions, …
*   all “work” positions against healthiness or family life and/or without real guidance how to gain healthy one

#### concurrency fights {#concurrency-fights}

*   *** hidings during selling ***
*   *** corruptions in competitive tenderings ***
*   *** fights between colleagues ***

Most powerful arming in these fights is oversimplification during contemporary chattings:

*   We have to learn how to distinguish in our daily naming between means suitable for reach and poor ones: for example to leave in city for reach ones can be healthy as far as these people own other means - mainly enslaving power above theirs slaves.
*   We often hear "be flexible" and in detail unfortunately it means "be cheating, be unfair, or even be violent if necessary".

#### fails in treating children and other weaks {#fails-in-treating-children-and-other-weaks}

*   we (believe and) work hard on having capacity to feed anybody who joins us
*   we (believe and) work hard to have capacity to feed and carry anybody immobile who joins us
*   we (believe and) work hard to have means to save any our member against violence

#### monetary forces {#monetary-forces}

*   we basically are not against money at all: we use them as a company a much, - But - we _refuse to feed ourselves by business_: because monetized abstraction abstracted us away from our basic right: to be vitally inter-connected with health primary-source: carrying garden and to grow in garden.
*   On the other hand - we do not fall to other extreme: we do not “spend whole life and body” in garden: we are going to join the garden, but only in “_convenient_” way, and few hours a day. (And we are not there to do serf “job”).
*   ownership - and monetarily defined ownership is the core of this problem: we experience unavailability of sophisticated facilities in mainstream culture because we fell to view where privately-owned things are not for sharing.

To say that money do not create these negative monetary forces is like to state that guns do not create large-scale killing. (Soldiers and mafia workers can be careful "not to kill" rather just to immobilise...) We need to be brave to look onto how particular technology used makes particular strategies easy! About these hard monetary forces you can best study at [zeitgeist educational archive], but let's name most impacting ones here:

*   **_non-discrimination between companies and households_**: fundamentally destructive impact of (big) loans on (quite poor) households: Destructing most basic functioning of household: reproduction of national population and (emocional) care of children of the households. (Do you know to where population of original inhabitants of the country is going? Do you know who “balance” total fertility rate? - I mean do you know immigration fertility in the country?)
*   **_netocracy of “democracy” representatives_**: big corporations destruct most fundamental functioning of democracy: Representatives no more represent res-publica, but percept themselves as too dependent on corporations and thus (corruptedly) serve those. (In these days, banks cannot bankrupt from owner perspective; only from clients perspective...)
*   **_unavailability to start own business_** without falling to loans; not saying to start from scratch without loans at all. This has 2 aspects:
    1.  inability to start (small) business without corporation-oriented technologies: markets are (blindly) oriented towards **_goods_** producible only by extremely expensive technologies (mostly artificially cost-increased). Even technologies - usually fabric-placed _big machines_ for reasonable goods like gardening tractors, biogas stations, stirlings and so on are reasonable it point of sharing: and monetized “sharing” pushes non-holders to “worker-only shareholder” - actually slaves holding nothing. This is yet made more solid defensible by [patents and licensing]
    2.  inaccessibility of end-consumers (households) for small businesses: where plebs is going to give theirs moneys: in “market plazas”. Those are not **_markets itself_ **in original sense: there are no other sellers than corporations. How you could reach household consumers as non-corporation?

At these days: the match for household consumers is finished: corporations grasped the market.

*   **_work market quality_ **- from households perspective: we experience extremely bad conditions for labors in terms of salary, shift-timing, labor-unions, and more - even with this conditioning oriented towards companies, still the market is unstable: because of “_crises_”. In these days, crises will come again and again - artificially, because bank owners have only profit from it.

#### imperialism hierarchies {#imperialism-hierarchies}

*   **patents and licensing**: ***get as example simple wish about instalment and usage of small-farm-sized biogas station. Only way to there is to pay a certified company - which obviously doesn’t specialize on too small station components... Even if you know how to install all components according to most precise norms, you still have to pay certified company for that. Even to be “bio producer” is made as highly expensive business just by these certification. Best way from this self-lock is actually our “business plan”: we are going to collect reasonable amount of _“knowledge” (certification) holders_ and [big machines] (those reasonable only when shared) and become a company / cluster of companies which in theirs sharing breaks through this system-based slavery.
*   *** ownerships of land-resources and materials-resources***
*   **_bad design_**: in many areas, we are enslaved between badly designed facilities: recall how you were not able to get simple small component of printer, of toilet, of kitchen technology; recall how expensive are things to “modern” cars, and “modern” houses. Those are not real prices, those are not senseful limits in availability. That all is here only for corporations benefits. → Let’s choose [good designs] for our lives!

*   **_professionalism+consumerism_**: yes, we experience negative side effects of that lobby called professionalism: In current mainstream we see so intensive push to prefer only those products over “simple personal production abilities” that after all no-one thinks that could be able to compete against “other producers” and certificating supervisors. This generates on the opposite side unlike resignation: consumerism: People mostly feels as consumers-only: they tends to think that only usable equipments are those bought. - We evaluate such posture critically: it is psychological disease similar to addiction. In contrast to that we at us tries to learn that most of things around us we can perceive as SFG (intermediate personal products).

3 (mainstream-mindset) “**_only-means_**” for happy future of individual-and-family

*   Mainstream often argues that only means for having happy (safe) future - reached by high-income - are:

1.  be high _manager_ for masses: mainstream people usually maps this to _career_: gain “position” - gain “responsibility” - gain “power”. We do not accept this model, simply because not-all can be manager for others: we are social, sorry...
2.  be deep _specialist_: some people don’t want to be slavers; and they have such a luck, that they can use theirs exceptional “geniality” to be “rare” and they become _consultants_. We accept this _career_, we propagate this, and we try to support this by our education-enablings with hope more people will go to enjoy this. -- In mainstream society is this path highly difficult to reach: hierarchies makes it difficult artificially and absurdly from our point of view. Main point of our implementation is that deep specialism is not bond to need of startup & continuation money investments. -- See [career paths ***].
3.  be _capitalist_: this way is obvious: be owner of workers and/or remitters. This is against [right for equal opportunities] from our point of view.

#### cultural fights {#cultural-fights}

*   every co-house defines 'client-zone' which is at best red-zone, but of course can be any other zone. For example blue zone for people in therapy.
*   behind this zone, there is internal one, which cares workers and internal-visitors.

Co-house culture and co-house facilities are cared by co-house holder. S/he defines what to wear, what to consume, and what to do where. In case of conflicts s/he has to formulate it in terms of written 'co-house definition'.

*   this role cannot be holded longer than 5 months; and cannot be returned back to you earlier than after 5 months.
*   this means that you can hold the co-house/culture maximally 3-times: 5+5+4 months in your 2 yrs period...

#### we are not.. {#we-are-not}

In our inner term this paragraph would be lose of time, but (unfortunately) in outside word, there is dominance of people with other than clearly constructive-and-compassionate (red) intents; so we should distance from theirs labels:

*   **_we are not against “consumption”_**: we consume, and we consume a lot. But - we do not misuse others for have our consumption “exotically large”.
*   **_we are not against “reachness”_**: when company is reach, it's stakeholders are reach effectively too. And when our company is stated to be big.
*   **_we are not against “big companies”_**: but we are against “corporations”: we accept and like big _cooperatives - with transparent stock-and-knowhow_. We also provide friendly space to fan-clubs of people which are against big companies actually: if they accept our transparency condition… - see [small is nice]
*   **_we are not against “certified quality”_ **of services: this is completely independent intention then _professionalism_ - which is mainly concurrency-fights mean. At us, we gain certified quality transparently and for free!
*   **_we are not against “vajrayana fans”, meat-eaters, christians, sufites, newage,..._** _and so on_: We are not any kind of church: from outside perspective we are like cluster of villages in close partnership - that’s all. We like to provide friendly space for people with all kinds of _metaphysic_ modelings. We are pro-life oriented. -- Something like “Economy-oriented URI CCs”: We welcome those all - if they accept our non-violence and transparency conditions - our system… - see whole [diversity training]
*   almost stupid to mention such matter of course, but **_we are not here doing or evangelizing “universal solution for all”_**: our solution is here only and only for those with similar taste and for those willing to follow our strictly specialized criterias. Is it clear?

As we stated that we are not “universal solution”, already from that moment it should be clear, that we are not “communists”. But it will be good to conture all varieties of differences:

*   our solution is here only and only for those with serious interest. We are not here for those who are not interested to go our way; and even we are not **_going to fight against_ **them to dominate them; nor our goal is anyhow correlating to wish on harming them.
*   communists (in mainstream sense) were never propagating people’s (material) equanimity: classes fight were from beginning understood as fight of class grasping power _above_ of those who goes to be _under_ (all non-communists). They used **_social-levels_ **and very differentiated _own property_ after all too. Our goal is complete (material) equanimity including such regulation which effectively disables to grasp the power anyhow.
*   communists (in mainstream sense) were never for **_complete transparency_**. They were fundamentally based on secrecy which is inseparable part of psychology of war. We are doing here in complete transparency. -- You already know it.
*   communists (in mainstream sense) were never **_against violence_**. It is clear. Violence is deeply prevented in all different levels of our processes. If you don’t believe, come and see.
*   communists (in mainstream sense) were always **_against religions_**. We so far are trying any possible means to have religious people in our community: as far as they like to be friendly to others and as far as they like to be non-violent in houses of theirs dominance. We believe and we see that this is possible, even when you do not see it in your daily live.
*   communists (in mainstream sense) were at some point talking about annulment of private-property. We always counted with this mean (even when in form equal to all).When communists though about saving of basic people need, they told about **_“flat” and “work”: we from definition cannot go to such big oversimplification_**: Actually they named it like that to justify themselves: they generated “working [only] class” just for themselves. We will always think and talk about “basic living needs” (which include beside living-cell also garden and family/community) and about “work periods” (which primarily must be healthy and cultivated, not dirty-labourer leveled).

Let’s summarize here yet list of concepts which we are programmatically trying to overcome:

1.  we try to live without **_violence, lies, and imperialism_**. Without explanation it is really hard to imagine anything concrete behind such saying. - So please, see [3E training]. For most important implications in daily let’s name:

*   we try to live without any **_competitioning_ **like those at **_markets_** or at **_arenas_**. [See our markets Qs]
*   we try to live without **_undocumented businesses_**. [See our KB]
*   we try to live without **_bigger private properties_** than that _‘for minimal insurance of good personal comfort_’ -- [personal kit]

1.  we try to live without **_money_**. Even when we still agree with statement that money are very effective _enumeration_: of business values and (generally available) resources values.
2.  2<sup>nd</sup> level of 3E is this:

*   we try to live without **_beings-engineering_**: In mainstream, monetization and professionalism together generated very sick situation from our perspective: treating beings by (uncontrolled) machines (including monetized business-machineries): we do not think that this is necessary at all.→ At us, we do not have markets of meat: only personal treatment of animals is allowed at us. [See ***]→ At us, we do not have HR positions: only generally wide performance calculations we maintain: No need of having position to sort it out.
*   we try to live without **_hierarchies without feedback_**: In mainstream, it is usual, that subordinate do not have any (impersonal) feedback onto what higher-up has on him/her. At us we use concept of “Whatever is about me, i have in my dashboard.”
*   we try to overcome **_in-house competitioning_**: → see our [in-house Qs/balancing and cleaning circulations].

1.  we live without **_career-bond livelihood_**: → our livelihood is based on very peaceful eco-living→ our career is based on “pure fun”
2.  we try to live freely without **_art--recording mixture_**: In mainstream, where autonomous recordings are not sellable: where is always someone with interest in profit, there is hardly imaginable to have hope on clean-view:→ At us, we strictly distinguish between raw-recordings: not touched by anyone and those “art-works” - touched media. This is possible by tracking (recording) every-bit of modifying access to data and modifying touching of goods.
3.  we do not use **_loans_**: everything has to be “payed” just in time

*   we know, it is not easy; it has 3 work-outs:

→ many goods and services are done by public-services fans-clubs just for free

→ other goods for personal goals: you have to do by yourself

→ yet bigger goods: you have to fund project-oriented co-house / fans-club

*   see many examples in [green] and [blue] zones

1.  as we stated [at we don’t have paragraph]

*   we do not have driver jobs, we do not have night tech-shifts
*   we do not have shops, nor seller-jobs, nor adverts and it’s makerswe do not have markets - other than workshops

### Cooperations {#cooperations}

*   Yes - we have some suppliers. All of them must be fair trade and bio. We do not require from them to use “work tracking” knowledge sharing.
