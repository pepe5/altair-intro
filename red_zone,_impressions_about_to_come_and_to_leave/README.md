# Red zone, impressions about to come and to leave {#red-zone-impressions-about-to-come-and-to-leave}

-- is interface to outside world. (We look from outside red colored.)

*   main purpose of red zone is to protect our employees - ie. our stockholders.
*   we mainly protect theirs privacy, theirs interests, and theirs property at all.

### 1st pros and cons counting about our company {#1st-pros-and-cons-counting-about-our-company}

*   we have quite minimalistic private facilities - and equal to all
    - but we don’t have any loans
*   we do not have full-time specializations
    - but we have enormous amount of training means for part-time specializations
*   we do not allow creativity and competitions -based job careers
    - but we require quite big part of working time to be spent by creativity

*   if you like our attempt of human-live support - you are welcome
    - but you have to accept our requirements
*   is most known, that we are “big brothers” (we record: 1/non-private activities, 2/resources use, & 3/biometrics),
    - but we -all- brothers & sisters are here and willing to (literally) push out - everyone who feels need to be free from this. (S/he has to understand, that we also want to have him/her to be free from us - if s/he wants so.)

*   3 biggest “outside” visible motivations for coming would be 1/ life (quite reach mainly from social perspective) without loans 2/ knowledge sharing (mainly useful for becoming qualified for some crafting), and 3/ stunning travelling (enabling ones to travel with whole family for safe and convenient work anywhere: This is incredibly useful in today's era of enormous migration connected with discrediting long-term travelers name)
*   1 of strongest motivation to give “privates from previous era” to Company could be to enable company to accommodate own kins. But this is not allowed for new-comers. Conservation period is about 4-8 yrs. For this -quite long- transitional period, brown zone is used.

*   We say that: “we _refuse to feed ourselves by business_: because monetized abstraction abstracted us away from our basic right: to be vitally inter-connected with health primary-source: carrying garden and grow in garden.”
*   We believe that healthy lifestyle and happy live-carrying is distorted by performance striving / competing, so it can be achieved and lived without it much easily and more sustainably.

Imagine this: you want to know how to grow beans, apples, ginger, …; how to maintain saw-mill, wind power-plant, steam-cutter; how to conserve plants, weave flax, melt steel, craft glass tools, assemble engine; setup distributed storage, video conferencing, measuring biometrics; …

*   at us you can learn it all - for free
    - we have many SWs buyed which is used in R&D and in enterprices - all machines design, manufacturing numerics, CADs, plotting, automation and so on...

*   only condition is that all what you learn (uncommon) at us, or invent at us - will stay here, or under non-for-profit license

So after all, we can say best-fitting motivation for working with us is -

*   **_to unite to have good ideas about livelihood and society realized_**
*   we see that almost every low-motivations oriented man can co-op with others (even incompatible mate from larger perspective), and people with very similar higher-motivations still goes alone: this is effective root-cause of “bad situation in the world”
*   we are not for elite-oriented seekers. We are targeting mainly average performers with non-violent lifestyle and vision.

### Stress-free living {#stress-free-living}

Basically in mainstream society, you can distinguish between 5 different kind of “works”:

1.  “work” which is **fundamentally stressful**: races, killing or enslaving people, hazards, slaveries itself like for sex or drogs, … These are usually argued by formulations like this: “_if you don’t want to be beaten, if you want survive - then do these all harming things_”.
2.  “work” which could be done (theoretically) without stress, but organization of that activity is designed to have it **stressful by effectiveness pressure**: Stress is still fundamentally bounded to the position, because to work exceptionally and to be irreplaceable is stressful. These are mainly all “highly qualified” positions, like: programing, “emergency” management, slavery labourers mainly in factories, in health-care, & in companies competitions, … These are usually argued by formulations like this: “_if you want to success, then do this_”.
3.  “work” which could be done (theoretically) without stress, but organization of that activity is designed to have it **stressful by destructing employment rights**: These are all those “unqualified labourers” like: in building constructions, transport services, in factories, in health-care, … These are usually argued by formulations like this: “_if you don’t want to be replaced by some other waiting navvy, then do this_”.
4.  “work” which are basically stress-free, but in reality for many people is unfortunately stressful, because they fell to money income:outcome limit or to timing limits due to family or healthiness need. This kind of “work” is still cause of stress - because **in “work” market - there is not adequate better choice**. This is mainly pointing to lack of part-time positions, requalifications, too long commutations to “good work”, inability to moderate work timing with care of children, elders, and self.
5.  “work” which is happily experienced as stress-free: mainly because workers are enough qualified and reach to take chance to move and mitigate freely.

Workers are artificially and intentionally stressed by:

*   artificial timing
*   artificial consequences on quality performance: to place to which work is positioned is artificially too fragile: by both too unreliable tooling and non-redundant place-occupation
*   restrictions on sharing: both general and actual knowledge are artificially barriered out
*   social - black-sheep practices are practiced in collectives

What is _many troubles cause_ here - is not difference between these kinds of works, but “_work_” - the term itself:

*   you can claim that we used term “work” for activities which are included in term “job” only: Yes, all 4 named stressful works are actually stressful jobs: employments, or self-owned businesses. We used only “**_works for money_**” in our listing. We are usually persuaded by somebody that we hardly rely in life on it. -- And this is root-cause of stress.
*   we have to go to recognize that we actually work (on our lives), but actually not for money: we _can_ work on real life-resources.
*   the _work (the term)_: is yet more complicated by demagogy of _professionalism_ - where fight of knowledge-holders and projects-oriented paradigm penetrates everything: the same way as in shallow media demagogy the _monetization_ is sacrificed to be above human health. So here in our company, we strictly distinguishes between “basic work” (3hrs-period) which must be easy, relaxing, healthy, peaceful, and “timing-free” [*** see DAY INTRO]; and other “fun activities” (relaxation, creativity, & career periods) which are strictly highly voluntary.

### Problems of mainstream which are handled forward by our implementation {#problems-of-mainstream-which-are-handled-forward-by-our-implementation}

*   **_slavery relationships_**, direct pushings to slavery relationships, and sophisticated indirect organizational treatments which ends up in slavery relationships after all.- Please get in touch with modern slavery suffering at [***].
*   **_concurrency fights_ **for work positions, for living resources, for power in co-houses, for power in fan-clubs, concurrency attitude to nearby men which is going against friendship and openness. We are against any hiding!- Please get in touch with concurrency fights suffering at [***].
*   **_fails in treating children_ **at both family and nursery areas. Also any misunderstandings in consecutive analysis. We protect parents and all relatives in theirs right to be together if they all wish even if they are not 'the best' in some situations or roles. Protectors and coaches will assist in asking man every moment. - Please get in touch with fails in treating children suffering at [***].
*   **_monetary forces_**: we do not need loans, we do not need to buy basic things a even most of resources of comfort are available very easily. We do not need to sell our health, our family time, nor our ethic. - Please get in touch with monetary forces suffering at [***].
*   **_imperialism hierarchies_**: we have very limited, very flat, and always transparent hierarchies. No possibility to catch power through generation, no possibility to catch power longer than 2 years. - Please get in touch with imperialism hierarchies suffering at [***].
*   **_cultural fights_**: culture is realized on level of co-houses. Culture holders cannot extend this power over borders of the co-house, over 2 years period, and the power is conditioned by 'prosperity' of co-house facilities. - Can be withdrawn due to public or auditing evaluation.- Please get in touch with cultural fights suffering at [***].


### Introductory description of materials & services inter-dependencies: {#introductory-description-of-materials-services-inter-dependencies}

*   everyone has right to be “socially satisfied - by free-society services: *minimal personal comfort* is not bound to *slavery* anymore.

*   we do not have anything what do not has fans-base strong enough: (Except *minimal personal comfort*) We completely rely on fact that we will not have anything what we will not produce voluntarily in our free time.

    - As we have just 2 phases of our work-time: 3hrs obligatory (peaceful pace) for minimal personal comfort, and 3hrs optional (individually chosen pace) for any personal goal, we thing inseparably about our equipment:
    - Everything has to be produced the way which balance consumption need by it's enjoyable production live out <br />

*   our goal is to setup generations-long sustainability of our (healthily experienceable) infrastructure

    - to be able to do that we ***know*** about each-other (in terms of work) "everything": unavailability of this clear orientation of own ***dependency and possibilities*** in mainstream is unbelievable war-state from our perspective.
    - we ***know from where, by whom, and and how costy*** is every piece of crap around everyone of us
    - we ***know how to do anything***, and where to go to do it
    - we ***know who supports*** what each of us likes (or where would be loss of time to try there what is not supported there)
    - and most importantly we have time to do all around that
