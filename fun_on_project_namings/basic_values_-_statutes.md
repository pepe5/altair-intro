*   On the highest place there is [well-being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being). -- We believe that humanism is trying for just exactly this.
*   Well-being includes all levels of living (Maslow’s pyramid). All levels need to be nourished and protected - by social hierarchies.
*   We believe that our implementation is one of highest-quality implementation of Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. -- This is our goal.
*   We believe that also other people and organizations can “do well” to Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and in any time when anybody of us feel a need to move to place of other implementation, then - it will be (by easily-accessible way) provided to him/her.
