## Basic values - statutes {#basic-values-statutes}

*   On the highest place there is [well-being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being). -- We believe that humanism is trying for just exactly this.
*   Well-being includes all levels of living (Maslow’s pyramid). All levels need to be nourished and protected - by social hierarchies.
*   We believe that our implementation is one of highest-quality implementation of Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. -- This is our goal.
*   We believe that also other people and organizations can “do well” to Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and in any time when anybody of us feel a need to move to place of other implementation, then - it will be (by easily-accessible way) provided to him/her.


*   Looking on what all great - the civilization have done on [[Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5Q4nORTE6E)] and for [[Souls](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhu22aDzos)], we see that there is enormous much of Good (in terms of developed support of rights to live personal-spiritual understanding for each of us) and that there is evilly much of Misery (mainly in terms of destroying effective rights to live without beating, hungriness, and in terms of destroying effective dignity for average man of live without loans from monetary corporations). Our company is here not to do something like enforcement to move all into utopia, but to do very practical steps to be innovative, healthy, and at the end be helpful for those who wishes similar way.
