# Fun on project namings {#fun-on-project-namings}

*   business name is **_“Project ALTAir” - pointing to_ **[**_Project Venus_**](http://venus.org/). In terms of compatibility, we can be realized by what is described in Venus, if organisers agree with our values and its protecting means. It also point to: _“You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”_― Richard Buckminster Fuller @ [**_PM_**](http://www.possiblemedia.org/about/) and to [**_OSE_**](http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Factor_e_Farm)(This our agreeing on Venus design is not matter of course: we have very strict requirements… For explanation see [_Applied touching vision_ in Spiritual-book].)
*   “Zeitgeist implementation” - our project is strongly inspired by what is identified as destructive in social hierarchy in Zeitgeist medias. We propagate Zeitgeist media as one of good educative sources. Main point here is that Zeitgeist brings (beside other things not necessarily subjects of focus) - brings wide view onto **_civilisation-inhabitants self-understanding_**. -- Our project is big and needs wide self-understanding.
*   “Happy farmers - Happy hackers - Happy crafts” - propagates TNH’s Happy farmers idea. This is only exemplar referral, but important here is that we are here to carry visions and implementations of **_simple-living: the happy one_**.
