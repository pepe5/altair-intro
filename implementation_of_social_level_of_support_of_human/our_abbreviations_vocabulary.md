## Our abbreviations vocabulary :) {#our-abbreviations-vocabulary}

#### IO {#io}

*   We use instead of term “economy” - term “IO” [YOOH]; which is abbreviation of Input-Output; trying to reflect that this matter is not about insensible competing, but rather completely about inter-connecting. So instead of economy of a co-house or of a family or of a person, we have IO of it.

#### KB {#kb}

*   our shared knowledge-base

#### KIT {#kit}

*   short name of Personal-Kit

#### OP {#op}

*   is blue-zone position for hard-core fans of sharing

#### Q {#q}

*   short name of our Queues-System; part of KB

#### WC {#wc}

*   trainings-only term: Work-Camp is label which we is used for _towns_ -- emphasising terrible conditions of its inhabitants from our perspective. The same way we label by Camps-of-death such places, where killing is legalized. See *** [3E training]. Do not be confused in generalization, we support concept of towns: we have (few) real Towns: those of (internal) Venus Project: here we can be: not-enslaved.

#### WS {#ws}

*   it is counterpart of what WC is: In contrast to WC, Work-Shop/s is label for our co-houses client-area: our business plan.
*   it is public: anyone can come to consume it’s products
*   it is school-like - available for everyone: what we are shopping here is gaining skills and understanding
*   it is free (in terms of money): what we are shopping by here is our work

#### $

*   - we have of course a term of cost. But we do not evaluate it in monetary units. We use 'hrs/vectors' for it. See *** IO subject of our high-schools.
