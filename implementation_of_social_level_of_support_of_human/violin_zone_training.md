## Violet zone training {#violet-zone-training}

Describes our values by instructions for exceptional situations:

*   Be **_proactive_** - Our understanding of damage amount relation to impacting factors is that proactivity helps a lot. (*** see nacism, solitary-shooters, black-sheeps hazing, ***)
*   Let’s clarify at the beginning that violin obligations training is for 15+.
*   But instead of popular instructioning of “[_run-hide-fight_](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-act-violence/201408/the-truth-behind-the-run-hide-fight-debate)” (outdated at us) we have “**_pacify_**” instruction which is “_all dears aware_”...Make all dears run -- if it is safe,Make all dears hidden -- if it helps them all,…
*   You probably found out our **_brooms_** all around when you get your studies to this point… ***

### notes about “religion” institution {#notes-about-religion-institution}

*   definitively it can help seekers
*   it helps to nourish synergy of atmosphere, friendship, and support
*   it can help as information source, but here limits comes to impact…

No religion is perfect (in sense of support of well-being and non-violence)

*   even buddhists can meet propagators of “force means”
*   So after all, crucial is how often violence-propaganda can be heard by practitioner from whatever authority in his/her daily live and how often practitioner can be raped by those with power in his/her daily live.
*   → we do not accept any formulations proclaiming sense of violence (in meaning of violence-increasing reactions) and we believe that many formulations practiced by canonical “sources” can be reformulated easily at us. (No formulation describing violence -see 3E- can be said if aloud suffix about ***analogy*** meaning would not be added.)

### Violin cases {#violin-cases}

When someone aggresses someone -

*   We have obligation to start violin-zone process
*   It is valid when you are somewhere where one attack elseone physically or verbally, or when you perceive sign where someone agressses elseone somewhere - perceived ininindirectly

It is **_not_** valid when attack is not direct - for example when ‘attacked’ person is not present. Indirect stacks are not valid reasons for violin zone.

When Violin mode starts,

*   Aggressor has to be identified
*   aggressor has to be pacified (by proportionate means)

This also generate obligation to -

*   Record initiator’s act - positive record iff agressor is identified validly - otherwise opposite
*   Record agressor’s characteristics
*   Record all attendees’ characteristics
