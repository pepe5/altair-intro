## Let’s count some “Green” co-houses {#let-s-count-some-green-co-houses}

*   ***

#### Mahayana Co-houses {#mahayana-co-houses}

- are prominent holders of our vision: because they:

*   do farming
*   do not refuse to use machines (in non-slavery) works (mainly in kitchen, washing-rooms, and for transport).
*   defines and trains so called **_3MT/s_**:

1.  “Appreciation of Live”: **_no aggressive_ **“touching”, talking, or thinking.
2.  “Appreciation of Moment Possibilities”: **_giving up from resources imperialism_ **by energy of fulfilling possibilities of presence.
3.  “Loving Speech and Deep Listening”: **_no lying_**, deep and practical understanding of people and our community.

They also use yet 2 more in theirs 5MTs (those protecting from destructive sex and destructive drugs) - but those are not obligated wide in our company.

We can say, that our company-community is primarily “**_spiritual -- focused in inter-personal happiness_**” - For people not oriented so strongly into “spiritual labeling” we use **_3ε training_** analogy (Ethic, Ecology, & AEsthetic) which bases its energy in “humanity value” and “synergy business strength”.

#### “Hi-Green” Co-houses {#hi-green-co-houses}

*   plastic-free co-houses
*   crude-oil-free co-houses
*   “IT”-free co-houses: They interact to theirs IT-kit only by voice.
*   “tent”-free co-houses: Uses theirs tent-kit at minimal level: only in obligatory maintenance.

#### Hi-Tech Co-houses {#hi-tech-co-houses}

*   see Venus

#### Montessori, Protected Work-rooms, Inter-generations communities, ... {#montessori-protected-work-rooms-inter-generations-communities}

#### “Orphans” Co-houses {#orphans-co-houses}

*   no direct-blood parenting.
*   Even here we have “adult” roles: factory maintainers, nurses, or op/s-protectors; and they can be very young: everything is about gaining qualification and reliable reputation.
*   See model of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Children%27s_Villages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Children%27s_Villages).

#### Religion-fans Co-houses {#religion-fans-co-houses}

*   They propagate particular labeling-school. -- Even when they are trained and helping in trainings of labeling-diversity. Only non-violent conceptions of particular religion is accepted, which is actually quite strict condition.
*   Vegans are here too :-)

#### Hi-Share Co-houses {#hi-share-co-houses}

*   beside standard sharing (non-private acts, res-consumption, & bio-metrics), these brothers and sisters record & share audio (and some even visuals) from theirs private time.
*   These helps enormously: only these materials helps deeply in children education, parents education, & protector-ops education.
*   These recordings are tracked in users-end with high-priority, and frequently moved to blue-zone to be saved for most valuable purposes. Thanks, hi-sharers!

### Co-houses from clients perspective {#co-houses-from-clients-perspective}

#### general characteristic of openess {#general-characteristic-of-openess}

All our co-houses have obligation to be open to every newcomer. - There is limit per year defined from outside and implemented by [newcomers-queue](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13L9SdkDwsSZ4T8BSQkRLeE8_2zHWC6mXKaVtSuCnp-Y/edit). But practically, there is much more to be understood and used than this Q.

*   there must be clearly-defined and periodically used newcomer position and membership-gaining road-map
*   every position used in the co-house must be open: everyone with needed specialization must be handled with offer to serve it or to be trained for it.
*   every position is defined as by set of concrete tasks in some place: qualification training is done by reaching those tasks and cumulating hrs/acts of practise. No formalizing imperialism please...

#### public-services co-houses {#public-services-co-houses}

These are where all -

*   hospitals doctors,
*   protectors services: couches, informers, cops, ***
*   physiotherapists, masseurs, health-couches, ***

All our co-houses are very much similar to what mainstream names “work and travel”

*   you get interest in some place, you join its queue and go there. - Simple.
*   but beside this, there are co-houses / fun-clubs of fast travelling: luxury version of our free-movement implementation: main interest here is to save “personal position” for people going away for long term. [See permanent residency.]

#### public-facilities co-houses {#public-facilities-co-houses}

These are where all -

*   personal-kits
*   personal-tents
*   personal-fields settings up
*   public-facilities

- are going from _primary public club/s_.

It is important to tune expectations on what we have similar and what differs in thinkable equipment ever:

*   In terms of technologies, we have almost everything as mainstream, except fosil-based engines, and meat-factories.
*   Many machines/technologies we implement differently: for example electricity (micro) plants and installed in every co-house and distribution is load-balanced with policy of local satisfaction 1<sup>st</sup>. - Almost every sharable equipment is shared with nearest neighbours as implementation of high-availability.

#### note on “natural taxation” {#note-on-natural-taxation}

*   we use 3 resources for satisfying **_public interest_**:

1.  **_“natural taxes” reallocation_** -- here educative attitude dominates:
    *   at field-hr: food [6/9 bowls] is going to sheds - you can track; and children and parents track where it is going to.
    *   at tech-hr: the teaching obligations itself - are the tax
    *   at social-hr: caring those in need is highly educative when positions are share as they are

You have to understand by observing, that these “taxes” are not here to cover “costs” of public-sector products...

1.  **_public-club_** service -- is kind of volunteering fans service: huge sector. This is for what we are here in deep meaning.
2.  **_external-gov_** service / intervention -- we still pay insurance and social taxes; and we are ready to consume services dealt from it...
