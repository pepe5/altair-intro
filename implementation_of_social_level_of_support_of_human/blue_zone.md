## Blue zone {#blue-zone}

- is about “hard” values - like:

*   psycho-therapy, social therapy
*   children protection
*   government-hold COI-protection, here we use companies-cluster as motives separator
*   governmental taxes vs our inner time-banking
*   edge means like “grass” for ill ones
*   whistle leaking
*   …

Blue zone - is here mainly for educative purposes. We do not have “hard” values, which require social interaction for consumption at the moment.

In individual moments - it is not matter of the individual to handle transmissions between green and blue status. Cameras do it by itself. In social moment - it requires from individuals - to be educated “what is green and what is blue”. - And not to do “blue things when blue zone is not intended”.

### Lets describe the principle on meet {#lets-describe-the-principle-on-meet}

We accept, welcome, and make friendship with people which eats meat: but - of course - they must respect the condition, that they will not pay anyone to prepare it for them. In other words we have here only _animal-killers & theirs inmates_. This is actually very ancient model: and we consider it to be healthy.

*   But this animals killing is not “green” from point of view of our “standard” co-houses: children cannot look on it without deep commentary. - As well on any recording of “longer” violence, or sex act. These activities are not “black-listed” but “blue-listed”: they can be shared only with protecting commentary: explaining causes, feelings, protection-means, and emocional-means in deep range.
*   Obviously, because our children are not reared here as wolfs.

### Let’s describe some “extravagant” co-houses {#let-s-describe-some-extravagant-co-houses}

*   ***

#### Vajra Co-houses {#vajra-co-houses}

*   are typical by enjoying meat, alcohol, and non-paired sexuality.
*   Here of course - some activities are not considered as “green” from perspective from other co-houses: so from outer view those are marked as “blue”.

#### Co-houses cultivating genome Heritage {#co-houses-cultivating-genome-heritage}

*   These people enjoy “family” in wider sense: they have nursing aunts, “performance” trainers, and so on - instead of “dad - mum - children” model.
*   We have here people and children practicing performance disciplines. But even these people respect our rule - protecting us from competitions: they do it without direct feedback on competing results: so only personal “progress” can be experienced during exercise.
*   Also some co-houses which do not emphasise on getting children from most performing members, but doing performance disciplines - are considered to be this kind of co-house.

#### Therapeutic Co-houses {#therapeutic-co-houses}

*   specializes on particular therapy-method: which obviously imply data-sharing restrictions.
*   Example can be SOS Co-house for cure of harmed children.

#### Zoo/Breeding Co-houses {#zoo-breeding-co-houses}

*   joins theirs daily live with other animals (for other purposes then is our standard: eggs&milk)

### Supporting values outside {#supporting-values-outside}

*   How to support values in places from where we see so crazily bad inter-personal & personal conditions? We of course do not want use nor propagation of violence by religions, by mafias, by nationalists, - by anyone. We do not accept any such persons between us. But what with victims of them outside?

Therefor we accommodate and protect here:

*   whistleblowers
*   investigative journalists
*   violent situations researchers & trainers
*   all people willing to transform violent situations and to pacify it’s propagators

#### Certifications {#certifications}

*   As we are cluster of economically independent companies, we welcome any next company to join us. We welcome companies willing to join only some our particular project too. What is important for us well defined and continuously measured quality indicators set.

*   As a motivation we provide certification for free. Actually we are motivated to go for it because it's measures are coming into our KB and we are not going to lose much in case of your noncompliance because starting measures goes virtually over internet.

Actually continually certifying is very natural part of our internal live - so it is not big deal to do it anywhere. How it is incorporated in our nature?

*   1st step is about that begging measure is by itself - the question & answer of agreement on transparency → enabling us to automate. Non-automated implementations we do not consider as our way of certifying.
*   2nd thing is that performance requirements we do not have hard: we just measure statistics as evidence of your character and in case of facing some lower-limits, we generate warning in advance enough. See [_warming warning_]. - This approach comes from our understanding of ‘real’ education.
*   We have frequent trainings on measures which we do consider a key-role playing - _sensitive indicators_. This training is very practical and is continued by hidden provokers which ensures that you will get a chance to decide about fixing training - in spirit of warming warning too.

### Storms sailing {#storms-sailing}

*   when our storm is not anymore handle-able by “green-land” means, we have to enter a “boat” _protecting us_ in “high water waves”: we have to invite protecting mean of our company: a blue state - including all it’s parts - mainly protector ops
*   we mean, from time to time we do not have power to get us back from impression of violence-victims to impression of happy-sharing, but it is not physical violence of violin-state: most often case is when **_family-clan_** catches the co-house.→ then we have to plan -

#### emigration {#emigration}

*   this is important part of our free-movement right implementation.
*   it is form of 2-yrs circulation, where no of old-members rests in co-house after the transition.
*   when you apply for this type of refreshment, you will not rest in the co-house too.

When emigration plan is applied and implemented -

1.  applicant for the plan can apply for blue-access for this application
2.  team of “fans for this particular co-house emigration” is collected: amount and qualifications have to satisfy co-house operation needs. Team usually consists half by half from start-up applicants and protector-ops. This phase can be blue from old-members perspective...
3.  team comes migrated as newcomers and starts to be trained. Old-members gets notified that they are going to emigrate - they have to choose the destination… After notification of old-members, emigration plan should not be canceled anymore...
4.  when team reaches the qualification (= membership)→ physical emigration of old-members is realized

In fact, every co-house culture-holder -

*   tries to be as popular as to be worthy to do not receive emigration plan for his team…
*   he can apply for protection of ops and then coaching of all full and newcomer members is oriented towards all-inclusive satisfaction

### “Tracking” institute {#tracking-institute}

#### warming warning {#warming-warning}

*   what is not warned, it’s _backward_ _regulations_ are invalidated

#### backward regulations {#backward-regulations}

*   regulation must be applied to all find instances, otherwise is invalidated

#### deals and agreements {#deals-and-agreements}

*   what is not tracked, it is invalidated

### Layers model {#layers-model}

*   we draw our relation to “civilization” properties -- our loved heritage in _layers-model_ which brings 2 aspects in front of us:

1.  we do not have direct access to _live-resources_ behind the layer
2.  we require certain qualities from the layer itself
