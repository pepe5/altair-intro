## Storms dealing {#storms-dealing}

Let’s start slow opening of next topic by description of how we deal with “Storms”.

*   We are strongly “against” violence.
*   From introspective teachings, we know that violence starts in very inner and uncontrolled source: from “posture”. - Which comes from “wrong perceptions”.
*   We know, that _storms_ comes from _turbulent_ emotions, which are not sins, but simply elements approached inconsiderately. It starts at self-understanding, continues in percepting, labeling, planning, emotions-handling, self-expressing, communicating, and ends in treating others.

*   Founders do not have enough (law) means to protect what they founded: they are not and will never be the owners. The only solution is to use fans’ power.
*   Newcomers do not have rights to change what is “locked” (in state) by co-house charter (of the year) or by expressed clients’ wishes. - In sense of returning clients.
