## White zone {#white-zone}

Is electronic and anonymous. It is actually only anonymous activity possible in our organization. As all data medias - is cloud-stored and encrypted, but here by more keys - all keys are split to such number of key-parts, that it enables quorum for data access.

*   Main purpose of white zones is to reflect and deal with corruption and conspiracies on company level...

Again, everybody can try to found white zone, but here it is not middle-school subject as simple-purpose co-house nor high-school subject as public-purpose co-house, but here it is ‘university-subject’ - in terms of (our) highest-values relating… mainly You have to evaluate ethical maturity of every founder and you have to setup self-regulating penetrations.

*   Main point is that this unmonitored formation is here for company goals. - For individual / external goals you use brown zone.

As self-regulatory votings and penetrating inspectors and provokers are strong enough, so far we do not have problems with our white clubs, and our inspectors shares theirs impressions that the zones have positive impact roughly.

*   But it has to be always clear that every white club can be put into emigration process…

*   If some applicant reaches white-club membership-status (by voting about his/her ethical strenght)
... then s/he gets power of some special acts:
    - s/he has power of veta - in company decision-making votings
      (Just right next voting can make him/her out from white-status, but that's the how play goes.)

    - s/he has power to declare certain Q&A/s in our KB to be obligatory company-wide
      Most of our Q&A/s are just personal, or project/s oriented. Only interested people makes theirs contributions there. On co-house level, we have Q&A/s declared to be defining of the house *culture*: then those are obligatory for co-house members (and applicants). Most of Q&A/s company-wide - are not obligatory in strict sense: only those *charter-relating* are by default obligatory. For example, Q&A/s about particular investments need to reach a quora, but it is about 60%. White-member can make any question obligatory company-wide: and this can have big implications, because company has to follow it's evaluations then.

    - s/he with (at least) 2 white-mates can step in to blue processes
