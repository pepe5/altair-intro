#### *** moving tent around our open-land {#moving-tent-around-our-open-land}

→ *** what about you personal-field at that time? ***

#### *** joining tent to family cluster {#joining-tent-to-family-cluster}

You can join tents to family-cluster, but still if you want to enjoy reacher facilities that public one, you have to move to co-house cluster.

#### *** joining tents to co-housing cluster {#joining-tents-to-co-housing-cluster}

Ideal network of co-houses is analogous to honeycomb. This is not because of artificial-fashion. The factor is:

1.  same count of neighbours and at the same time
2.  same distance from neighbours

Squares net is OK too, triangles net is OK too. Important is reasonable amount of equal cells.

Limit of circularity distortion is going upto ellipsoid of 2:3.

Ideal pattern of co-house is hexagon (of honeycomb) or circle in general; in size from 1-member “farm” upto “big farm”. -- It is not intended to be in size of village: village is cluster of co-houses - as naming suggests. Amount of members and clients cannot go over 70 people (+/-).

*   In the **_central area_** of co-house there are buildings - **_members’ flats_**. Same sizes, same shapes. Approximately same distance from all work-positions.
*   **_Around center_** there are **_personal-fields_**. If the co-house is oriented towards physical interaction with the nature, all daily items of the interaction has to be in the same distance from member’s flats. If there are trees through the co-house central area (Of course there should be.) then→ those should be in same geographical position to members’ flats.
*   If co-house is built **_around small-factory_**, then→ it (factory) could be oval-like, or it could be linear - cutting the co-house yard to 2 halves, and → members’ flats have to be in same distance from center of the factory. Bigger factories / clinics has to be built under “surface level” (of the central area) or on pilots (in ring) around central area. -- Then still flats distance from “factory” center and oval-ratio has to be satisfied.

#### personal room {#personal-room}

*   personal hygiene: brush, paste, paper, towels,

#### material sources {#material-sources}

Every tent has

*   heating source
*   water/s source

#### choosing the tent model {#choosing-the-tent-model}

*   we have wide range of models: the equanimity is made by

1.  (quite strict) spec/s of geometry and (end-user defined) functionalities
2.  possibility to switching (almost) any time to different type… (couches guides you in that process.) And you have to be in detail educated in this process before accepting your 1<sup>st</sup> tent.

*   every piece has very well defined inputs, outputs, maintenance procedure, and all variety of limits: you have to be personally in harmony with kind of those I/O, and proc/limits: This is why you choose particular model; not because of color or fun.

*   during tent-training you chose I/O… which best fit to you: and you learn its requirements: Everyone has to learn at least 2 models: to have something to choose from.

### Details on typical life situations at “personal field” {#details-on-typical-life-situations-at-personal-field}

Personal field - is what everyone have to become familiar with.

*   we spend there 1-3hrs every day
*   we know what it needs every day - every month - every year
*   we know what it gives to us: what food materials, what wearing materials, what housing materials, what tooling materials.

*** Let’s describe this every bit mechanically - in terms of who-tos ***

#### 1 “obligatory” hr on (personal) field {#1-obligatory-hr-on-personal-field}

*   1 “obligatory” hr on field - can be done only on personal field obviously, because it is defining principle of obligatory period

This 1day 1hr “shift” is

*   to harvest about 9 bowls of (vegetables), and -
*   to prepare conditions for growing it

*   3 bowls are for your 3 main daily dishes
*   6 bowls are going to be transported to processing co-house

#### notes on bowls counting and handling {#notes-on-bowls-counting-and-handling}

*   *** minimum & maximum number of bowls to be harvested by own hands
*   *** minimum & maximum number of bowls to be shared
*   *** minimum & maximum number of bowls to be transported: you do not need to eat only what you harvested, transported, washed, cutted, boiled, flavoured, and served by own hands. ***

#### relation between 3hrs “obligatory” - and 3hr “cereer” IOs {#relation-between-3hrs-obligatory-and-3hr-cereer-ios}

So by doing “obligatory” works, you

*   gain healthy feeding (yourself and 2 wards),
*   healthy “housing” (in the tent) “social caring” - for you + 2 more, and
*   accessibility of all _rights_ - mainly availability to move to learn anything anytime and anywhere.

In terms of monetized mind-set -

*   by becoming (our “company”) member - you are going to be employed for “minimal wage” in position on your personal field -
*   which is going to cover your “basic needs” (to quite nice comfort), and -
*   where tax is about 60%, but -
*   usually (in good family and social healthiness - integration) about 40% you can get back easily; (so then tax going “away” to “not experienceable” (in short term) “public concerns” is about 20%)
*   All this is done tuned way - by interaction with nature: you are not pushed (by live relying) to monetize it on (monetized) markets - and by that to become part of money-slavery.
*   The wage includes ⅓ of direct outcome of your 1hrs “obligatory” period + “public-care services”
*   Public care is done “for clients” in co-house - maintained by fans of the public care.

### Details on typical life situations at 3 hrs “personal career” period {#details-on-typical-life-situations-at-3-hrs-personal-career-period}

Beside above described “general membership”, one can so much feel refreshed by comfort of “minimal wage and public care”, and attracted by our “factories” and advanced “services” so much, that one can go to join or to fund the co-house.

#### discussing reasons to join co-house fans-club {#discussing-reasons-to-join-co-house-fans-club}

*   personal wish to gain know-how of co-house maintained technology (trainings service)
*   personal wish to gain access to co-house members-area facilities and services
*   personal wish to develop something new what could be done under the co-house easily
*   personal wish to be in places, or with people which are under co-house maintenance
*   altruistic wish to care someone who benefits from co-house run extraordinarily
*   altruistic wish to care and grow co-house chapter (“deep fan”)
*   order to be there given from another co-house role (general services queues)
*   need to be there deducted from higher company-complex point of view (protectors role)

Of course - the reason arises as more relevant, when personal 2yrs-period is going to expire

*   we recommend to go to other co-house after 1.5yrs of staying in one place: you can be never sure that everything will go perfectly, and not→ you get half of year to go back

#### process of getting into co-house positioning {#process-of-getting-into-co-house-positioning}

1.  When we come to any co-house we can be served (we can ask to be served) as:a/ **_client_**b/ **_visitor_** (of clients at service-area, or visitor of house-hold area)
2.  When we come as house-hold area visitor, we -a/ can move around freely - not modifying anything,b/ go to some (work) position and watch or -c/ get interested in that. We express this to our physical guide or to op guide and we enters a **_queue for newcomers_** for the position.
3.  When queue grabs you, you enter (the position’s) **_newcomer-training_**.Training are not at us about watching. (We can watch without training simply.) So durings training we get series of newcomers-tasks and gaining _by-that_ the qualification.- By accomplishing 1 such task - you are becoming the co-house “newcomer member”.- When you do (transparently assigned - and nicely defined newcommers’) tasks - you hold the membership by that. The tasks have to be defined a way that they will not be more difficult (in terms of skill, energy, time, social-level) then senior-tasks at the position. See more in [starting up new co-house] chapter.This is also here to how to define “permanent residency”: you are resident where you have (physical) full-membership: things are designed such that you gain it in 3 months period.

#### career positions {#career-positions}

We can be - during personal career - ie. in co-housing - workplaces in these positions:

*   “co-house member” - the fan of its purpose & culture: ordinary one, or elected housekeeper.
*   internal visitor: being in training accomplish 1<sup>st</sup> newcomer task and to become a member trained in skills and roles doing.
*   client, and -
*   clients’ visitor: together with clients only in co-house public-zone
*   as newcomer position, we can be in a leaver position too: when you are in co-house, where is no other full member allowed to be there (in green mode): because of circulation years, then you enter brown-zone mode: you lost full membership and you are there only to train others. (Which means mostly only losing voting rights.)

#### personal membership-accessibility levels {#personal-membership-accessibility-levels}

Each co-house (fans-club) can define _computational_ proclamation of membership-accessibility for each person: Membership can be - based on computational evaluation of personal profile -

*   available through **_newcomers-queue_ **for newcomers-training
*   available **_a priori_** for newcomers-training
*   available as **_full membership_ **_immediately_ - when interest is expressed
*   available as **_honorary membership_** - simply already made: here without any obligations:In this case, by any activity of such _honorary-master_ membership-conditioning is satisfied simply because of trust to this person. Only implications of some disaster can be membership annulment.
*   available through queue with condition of being **_under e-guidance_**
*   waiting for some co-house **_declared conditioning_**: most oftenly preceding membership of other (“_entrance_”) club, or for example waiting for gathering up some work-hours at some preceding (“entrance”) position.
*   irrelevant because of **_mutually agreed unacceptability_** of complex of expectations:Of course during admissions between newcomers, an applicant must accept all what is propagated by the co-house (fans-club) and what is expected from the member
*   disallowed because of **_[blue-zone] evaluations_**. (Here we mirror nationwide regulations...)It is not possible to disallow applicant’s request because of his history - without nationwide reasoning: If s/he agrees with co-house demands, s/he have to be accepted.But of course we have much more strict demands on members - already on level of company-wide public: video-tracking of all working-hours is great demand already. Let’s recall, that co-house (/holder) can demand diet, dress (like burkas), specific labeling-system,... Let’s recall, that co-house can never demand breaking 3-6 hrs model, doing corruption; and is monitored on [indicators].

### Volunteering time {#volunteering-time}

*   Beside “hard-work” integration into personal co-house, one can choose another method to integrate to: volunteering.
*   The reason can be that during hard-work, you are a Mentor of the position, and you have strictly defined what to do there and when to be there.
*   During volunteering in contrast, you can be there or you can go a side, but you can be there as long as you wish.

*   Also you accept hard-work (career) position as long term job.
*   Best positions for volunteering are those where you come unintentionally and you just do whatever is needed. If taking of obligation is required for the position, you discuss volunteering there with coordinator maximally on weekly basis (not longer). (Yes, this fundamentally influences capacity planning.)

Your engagement can be classified as volunteering if:

*   You are not asked to do the job by anyone, only one who can ask you for it is that one who is trying to get _confirmation_ from you about your previously expressed wish to be there: almost uniquely a coordinator of the project.
*   You know what to do: you reached the qualification for it
*   If your position is covered by a mentor at least virtually (by remote monitoring), or you have tandem volunteer beside to you

This way, many projects are going on

*   Thus, as a newcomer, you can be frequently asked if you wanna know about the Project IO: People are joining the projects as volunteers oftenly.
*   Best volunteers are those fresh and fit ones: we are doing maximum to have people in this good shape.

### Basic Co-housing IO {#basic-co-housing-io}

_NOTE: We use instead of term “economy” - term “IO” [YOOH]; which is abbreviation of Input-Output; trying to reflect that this matter is not about insensible competing, but rather completely about inter-connecting._

#### positions professionals {#positions-professionals}

Imagine you are member of decision-making board of a co-house; (Every non-newcomer member of co-house is in the board.) - and you think about co-house need to do something extraordinary to ensure its bright future:

*   You will sit and look in our great KB and look for someone who has good results in the particular area and -
*   you will join his Queue …

People can be good in many different specializations and many of them can help the co-house:

*   house builders
*   machineries reconstruction builders
*   team builders
*   art & culture trainers
*   ...

#### transportation {#transportation}

*   for fast transportation we use tubes. Biggest ones is dimensioned to carry 2 adults, or 1 adult + 2 children. Smallests are of dimension of classical tube-post - mainly for vegetables & cutted woods.
*   Yet bigger goods have to be transported by our “slow-mo”: going by 7kms/h…
*   Slow-mo can also walk behind us to give tube’s gates still near to us all the time…

All this is here to -

*   protect open-country quality for both mankind and other-nature inhabitants (nature-looking, penetrability, …)
*   protect autonomy quality of technology equipping of our (mankind) society
*   autonomy quality is here strictly required to protect people from:1/ firing a body by lifting heavy objects2/ firing time by carrying objects3/ degrading society by sacrificing such unhealthy “jobs”

We do not allow anyone to drive a vehicle

*   anything going faster than slow-mo -- must be autonomous-tram style:- it goes only on trails- it has in advance arranged destination- it is small as we said
*   we protect our members by this from being pooled to driver employments

Let’s make overview how production-consumption flows of goods out of personal-sector ***:

1.  there are **_places of natural resources_** in nature. These are “under Qs” of resources bidders and important-flows. We do not use other means of ownership…! Anybody can come.
2.  healthy way of harvesting delivers them to 1<sup>st</sup> production-line. **_Production-lines_** are co-houses where technical works are done. -- People are working here;Production-lines begins with
3.  from these places subproducts are transported to next production-line by **_autonomous-transport_**! -- No human drivers, no human carriers!
4.  last stop are end-user **_delivery-sheds_**

#### membership consumption {#membership-consumption}

*   Basically we can consume _material_ facilities & services of ‘own’ co-house / fans-club only in theirs _physical_ area. In area of other co-houses we can consume only _‘virtual’_ services of the co-house, which is e-resolutions of e-requests basically. (Exception is [protectors]’ coping; see [Blue zone].)

*   at 1<sup>st</sup>, we all are members of the company: i.e.: we are **_clients of public-facilities fans-club_**: we all consume personal-kit, personal-field, and open-land facilities. - By simple 3hrs ‘obligatory periods’ we reach this service.- This is very convenient - even though quite minimalistic :).
*   at 2<sup>nd</sup>, most of us are residents of some **_local co-house_ **where we are doing our 3hrs ‘career upskilling’- This is reach place, full of hi-tech widgets, fragrant buildings, and very nice people.
*   some of us has “big dream” and therefor be part of some **_virtual fans-club_**, contributing to the value. Being _on-site_ is not privilege for everyone, but helping remotely is very necessary. This can deliver to you, and usually does, after some working-hours to be allowed to _travel & enter_ some high-end area / service.
*   there can be co-houses conditioning theirs production forwarding by presence of theirs member in the destinations place. At such case, receiver of the goods is not the traveling member, but the destination co-house as whole. This is strictly monitored and can lead to [emigration planning] if netocracy would be detected: everything must be transparent and impersonally declared. We call this **_temporally personal partnership_**.
*   we can also in fact enjoy goods & services of all suppliers of our local co-house. We call this **_abstract membership_** consumption.

Then - also because we have 3 ‘career’ hrs, we have chance to serve +/- 3 positions in different near around co-houses →

*   + 2x (+/-) **_near co-house_**: local co-house is that one, where your personal-tent is assembled, near co-houses are those where you can go in about half an hour.

#### products consumption {#products-consumption}

*   we -of course- like to eat more than raw-veges, eggs, and milk. We like far more than what is made and distributed by [public-fans]. For this we join co-houses, we make it there, and we consume it there

We are society of people **_locally-oriented_** in terms _availability_ of things & services: the more produced locally the better. - But **_globally-oriented_ **in terms of inhabitants free-move.

1.  in level of **_food_ **and **_tent-maintenance_**: → every **_person_** should be independent-- for building field and tent up - to be ready for handover to the user, there is strong support of public-club co-houses; no payment is expected back - except “natural taxes”. See _public-_ co-houses in [co-houses from clients perspective]
2.  in level of **_basic-common_** life-resources: → every **_co-house_** should be independent-- for building co-house up - see [starting up *** IO]
3.  in level of **_complex-life_ **needs: → every co-houses **_village / island_** has to be independent-- good orientation in this problematic, see preppers movement
4.  there should be nothing what has to be named _need_, what cannot be server in the island. More motives -- wishes can go much more far; and we encourage to travel “abroad” for your dreams.

We join co-houses to maintain, to teach-&-learn how to maintain, to maintain its inputs and to produce, distribute, and consume its outputs.

*   we do not use advertisements! we use e-catalogues - as in all our data-works (no papers)
*   each product has no artificial (business) name: it has only:
    1.  photo of itself (no packing): photos are made during production, and then are selected on consumer preferences in his/her browser
    2.  extremely detailed listing of components: sortable, searchable, evaluating-able, and trackable to its very origin
    3.  address of origin: its each components’ (trackable and so on) address, its each producers’ address
    4.  all is video-recorded
    5.  everything has forums-like comments, recommendations, and evaluations attached to it itself
*   see more details and relation to queues at [[catalog parameters](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13L9SdkDwsSZ4T8BSQkRLeE8_2zHWC6mXKaVtSuCnp-Y/edit)].

Co-houses of course do barter-business with each other

*   but of course - none is hidden: everything is public.
*   we track in detail consumption rates, wishes, and trends of our co-house villages and when there is some wish dealt as reasonable in [decision-making circle***], then the producer is asked to direct its products toward our co-house / village sheds.
*   exchange rates are usually based on outside prices, but it can be agreed more effectively if there is no claim against.
*   at production side our basic rule is to have always “safe” over-production. When overproduction can be used outside of company, we use it: mainly for charity and/or propagation purposes.

Let’s describe one example: comparison of way towards -

*   hand-mixer
*   dishwasher
*   hearth
*   tractor

### Starting up {#starting-up}

When one wants to found a co-house, s/he has to take into count:

*   place: choose from “public-land”
*   declare roles: don’t forget that the positions are here to be always opened.
*   declare **_public service_**: as is already known every co-house has to provide place for this. Size is directly proportional to number of co-house members.
*   define **_public zone_**: every co-house must have this to have place for newcomers and visitors which do not know anything, or which want to use public service. This zone must include at least 1 “public-flat”.
*   mitigate catchment **_public facilities_**: Amount is directly proportional to number of co-house members.
*   ***

#### choosing place {#choosing-place}

*   You can choose the place only from “public-land” around.
*   You can place maintained facilities to public-land - (only) if you do not restrict access to it.
*   You can get place of [emigration plan] - this is most preferred source for choice from company perspective...

#### obligations to be provided by every co-house {#obligations-to-be-provided-by-every-co-house}

*   visitors-handling procedures
*   newcomers-handling procedures (mainly definitions of newcomers tasks for every position)

#### life-cycle enumeration {#life-cycle-enumeration}

Based on [daily-intro] let’s try to enumerate consumption needs of “average man” and ways of handling them:

**_co-house building days_** -

*   **_digger_**: ***

#### levels of co-houses {#levels-of-co-houses}

We stated that main purpose of co-house is not to provide _housing_, but to provide _work positions_. We can tend to mix these things because our co-houses looks like houses in farms usually, but for providing housing we have _personal-containers/s_ (called _personal-tent_). Nice naming of what co-houses are here for is to provide **_workshops [WS]_**:

*   co-houses are public: anyone can come to consume it’s products
*   co-houses are school-like classes
*   what we are shopping here is gaining skills and understanding
*   by what we are shopping here is our work

1.  **_Null-house_**: best to fund a co-house is to gain some certifications & machines somewhere: in not-your-own co-house:

*   you go for training there: you gain skills **_how to maintain_** “machine of your dreams”

1.  **_Assembling-house_**: when trained,

*   you go to **_built_ **here your own “_machine of your dreams_“

1.  When someone wants to **_fund_ **a co-house s/he is alone or only with few mates:

*   his/her co-house can have 1-2 client positions
*   his/her co-house can have 1-2 newcomer positions
*   his/her co-house can have 2hrs of opening-hours: → no shifts-based service
*   his/her co-house can have setup Qs (both IN & OUT) → no public-fans still established
*   there is no long-term business plan: → you need to find at least 2 people for circulation (4) years to set up long-term business: So usually small co-house flourishes in family with at least 1 adolescent or in very open atmosphere for newcomers.

1.  You are in **_start up_ **phase:

*   we try to gain people: most important products here are couchsurfing and business-plan creativity-games. Goal is to get 2 full-members and 1 newcomer for each essential position.
*   we **_try to “certify”_** our co-house into long-term Qs.Certified co-houses can receive help in year of circulation

1.  when plugged into long-term Qs:

*   you can apply for subsidy titleWe do not use start-up subsidies at level of our companies-cluster: At us, every newcomer comes to some co-house to gain qualified skills and do his own. When the place looks attractive enough for him/here, s/he will stay...

1.  Now, we have small machines and big machines -- even when [small is nice] at us - because it is good design criteria. So bigger machines usually requires more positions. (Even small but high-end machines require it…)

*   So we have more positions around the machine - all need 2+1 staffing.
*   We measure and monitor **_self-independency_**

### Details on typical life situations at “consumption fun” situations {#details-on-typical-life-situations-at-consumption-fun-situations}

#### *** world-round trip {#world-round-trip}

#### *** enjoying “tantra services” {#enjoying-tantra-services}

#### *** long-queues “exchange gray markets” {#long-queues-exchange-gray-markets}

What people would want to exchange just hiddenly - in outside / brown zone:

*   Long time awaited goods
*   Votes in referendums and investment Titles
*   Protection and sympathy in entrance processes

We do not offer internally any means to protect us against that:

*   We believe that our egalitarian structure of our society makes things so bad smelling for dark trade, that it would not hunt a potential consumer.

On the other hand, you can offer a future promise at public: at your personal e-site,

*   But it becomes a part of your personal-profile.
*   We do not consider this as violation against our policy: if it is made by our Queues - and thus it complies with our non-discrimination perspective.
*   Violating offerings are composed frequently, but warming-warning is applied then, and it works well.
