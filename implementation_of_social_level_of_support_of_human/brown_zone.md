## Brown zone {#brown-zone}

With people which clearly expressed theirs wish not to become members - which are mainly **_our relatives_** and our ex-members - but which still want to co-op at some level, we have brown zone. 2nd most known usage of this zone from perspective of our individuals is **_personal business_**.****This zone is characterized by specification of investment limits to them.

This brown field can be described from company perspective as:

*   co-op projects with ex-members - our high priority is to make them sense our unconditional friend-ship even when they lieved.
*   IO contributors co-operations - long-term ones, both private and governmental. Here is key point that this co-ops are motivated by money-only.
*   In above one - we can include this IO: dealing with externals we are obligated to deal with: eg. “our government” grasps of our members
*   Long term interactions with resistant relatives. These are our older relatives and even our children for whom our high-end experience-based education failed to mediate Sence of what is valued for us.

One of main aspects of trainings for people specializing to brown-fields is to sense and nourish sources of relaxed atmosphere.

Although time spent in brown zone will be recorded if it is at our company place / facility, still the recording doesn't go to a personal profile.

Investment limits are motivated by company resources and company reflection of individual limits, but it has effective implementation on level of individuals mainly:

*   Time spend at brown zone is treated similarly as ‘position time’ → you cannot spend more than **_2hrs a day_** at one position.
*   Difference is in possibility to **_cumulate_** unused hours over to next days.
*   In addition to those 2hrs we have -as every company- 5 weeks of **_vacation_**: These are a brown zone too.
*   To have personal-business brown is not only option and this brown-business has yet some limits: if you decide to do your taxation by yourself, you become part-timer from our perspective and this implies you to become a supplier with its requirements: you have to be transparent-quality (and then yet fair-trade, and animals-fair, and drug-free, and guns-free,...) → otherwise you fall to gray-suppliers class and you lose vote in investment referendums.

What is not a brown zone:

*   When you apply for non-paid **_temporary-leave_**: at this case you have to give back whole your personal kit and in time of your return, you will face obligation to go through all our entrance trainings and you will be in 3 months newcomer-period - without full-member rights.
*   Also **_public-holidays_ **are not brown. They are kind of blue-days: you have to do your 3 obligatory hours - as far as this is individual-level of self-sustainability. But you are freed from career hours: precisely you can go there, but you cannot deal about it in advance, and they will not be recorded to your profile. (Similarly to brown zone.) But -as far as these places are company-holt, - as far your recordings will be subject of blue archives.
