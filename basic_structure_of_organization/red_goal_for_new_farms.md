## First welcoming
We appreciate much any willing to cooperate. – We do not stick on black & white understanding of requirements on new-coming participants:

New coming farms can join us partially by aspiring to cooperation in:
1. providing “minimal” housing, food, & “personal” IT to all new-comers (so called Necessities) – equal to all
2. providing open & easy access to all work positions (mainly 1/ open & easy trainings onto that, and 2/ open & easy schedules balancing), open & easy recording of all work positions, and participating on open & easy inter-cohouses exchange of members – equal to all
3. providing general egalitarian trainings (namely NVC & sociocracy trainings) and particular network trainings (namely nation-wide democracy-accountability workshops, ALTair projects & vision workshops, Venus projects & vision workshops, Copoiesis, OSE, OHA, LETS, and so on)

-- This level of cooperation equals to [Red day](detailed_intro/cosmology_-_interstellar_structures.md). 
-- All this requires as matter of course to “cooperate” with National government on
* complying with Legislation: we do not create [“Parallel worlds”]
* complying with Taxation & Insurance: we accept fully this inter-dependence (not in sense of [SoroSS Orwelistan], but in sense of Nation’s-portion on humanism-support)

This level of shared standard is very inclusive – as it embraces: all eco-farms, religious-farms and monasteries, anarchists-bases, private-crafting farms, even progressive-socialists experiments.
-- This doesn’t require from coming farms:
1. participation on shared-profiles KB, nor participation on technologies-tracking KB
2. participation on 3-periods working-standard, nor participation on work-place redundancy occupation requirement
3. participation on 2yrs-cycling standard, nor participation on emigration-obligation emergency-right
4. participation on inter-cohouses sharing of equipment & income 
5. participation on obligated-voting KB, nor participation on obligated-trainings
