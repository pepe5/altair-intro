# Basic structure of organization {#basic-structure-of-organization}

Long-term “_preparation_” phase - is NGO.

Long-term “_live_” conception - is company. Later we can transform to form of local government and yet later there could be form of republic :) (This crazy 'later forms' we do not effectively plan to reach and if we talk about them we count on powers-separation - see [cosmology]. Actually, at current versions of our [Red-book] and [Green-book], we are here to be atractive and handy for just a minority of the population - see [[commentaries on outer structures and outer values](https://altair.gitbooks.io/intro/content/red_zone,_impressions_about_to_come_and_to_leave/commentaries.html#we-are-not)].)

Company form is necessary to protect participants from money handling. This is shares-stock form - only participants can be holders - all must have equal amount of shares. Here are some regulatory burden yokes - see chapter [red zone] ***.

Project itself goes through phases labeled similarly to zones - see chapter [projecting phases].

### Right to healthiness {#right-to-healthiness}

We start our description with describing relation and care on healthiness. We perceive health and happy live as so basic right that we do not accept any form of social organisation which would goes against it.

In work:

*   healthy live cannot have more than 6hrs for “work” - we have working 6hrs for all.(plus 1h:45m for transitions interspersed between 3 periods of that).
*   healthy live cannot accept any “work” over-times - we do not have them
*   healthy live cannot accept work irreplaceability - we use pair workers in all positions - by continually overlapping shifts
*   everyone has to have minimal working period in open nature - usually at field
*   work is diversified: 2hrs in open nature, 2hrs technical work, and 2hrs of social work - for all. Here are no exceptions. Only form diverses based on personal ability and orientation.
*   all work tasks of 3hrs obligatory period (in field, on machine, & with people) are able to be done with no hurry (including transitions between working places - we use 1h:20m gap in main pause and 40m in minor pause for food and transition).

**_Definition of “work”_**: healthy activity, which is not directly care of individual health, nor “fun with family & friends”. - It is (healthy) “planned” care of material-needs & non-self: This needs and nonself have nothing to do with money: it is completely separated from money businesses at us.

In individual and family life:

*   everyone have right to live in own “flat”. This flat must be very well equipped even if it is not big. No flat rents are allowed.
*   even people frequently travelling ones (like couch-surfers) must own “flat”.
*   people from 14yrs-18yrs spend major educative period how to “build” and maintain _the flat_, and grow the plants.
*   everyone have right to live beside of “his/her own” garden - which they by food depends on.
*   everyone have right to live beside of “his/he” work cooperative (co-house) - where s/he realize his/her career.

### Right to free movement {#right-to-free-movement}

We feel, that free movement needs healthy reflection on level of social regulation otherwise proclamation on this right will be fake. So we use these regulations:

*   every 2nd year - whole family is obligated to move to another place. People below 60yrs of age here are not allowed to be bound to one place.
*   people bound to friends can anyway move in circle. People are allowed to return to origin after living periods on 2-3 other places - _if_ - there will be free space according to Queue. (the space must be prepared in defined period/process.)

We implements also quite good free movement around working positions:

*   when people work in pairs, they can make quite convenient amount of absence after mitigation with partner.
*   also going to other positions is much easier - and is common... (See [Queue]).

### Right to privacy and private property {#right-to-privacy-and-private-property}

*   People are equal to each other in term of “rent” inducting private property. -- That is we strictly protect private property volume equal for all.
*   Privacy means right for tools protecting private safety & comfort. We disallows cruelty of loans destructing physical experience of choice, cruelty of over-times - destructing private live, and cruelty of inequal services constructed from netocracy/monetary inequality.

We are here to understand complex implications of actual and goal socio-economic systems used:

*   We usually think that “private” properties (in mainstream sense) are useful for us: those are protected against stealing, destruction, or forced unavailability by “private” status.- But it has very difficult consequence by this: you actually cannot use things which could be very valuable for you and you have to pay unreasonably high investment for very small amount of usage for what you want to use.- Best known example of resolving-try is **_car sharing_**. At our company we deal with facilities this way broadly: we share tractors, food-producing machines, clothes-producing machines, housing facilities-producing machines, fields, materials, sheds,...

We often think that private property is “only mean” (see all 3 “only means” in [[imperialism hierarchies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_WmdAeT4JpaNNRLEumzM6-qKFPdHVChXpPKE4AuK6Dg/edit)]) for happy (safe) future of individual-and-family:

*   in mainstream it is, yes. At us where only personal-kit is classically-owned, you can gain _control_ by high position only for 2 yrs: then we all are going to [circulate in refresh-period].
*   So what you will sustain “privately” only in long-term is your **_qualification_**.

Understanding of our model of “ownership” is beside [whole-day video-tracking] most difficult part for newcomers. We distinguish these levels of “ownership”:

1.  personal-kit ownership: this is **_private ownership_** in common sense

*   You have exclusive - protected access there (No one can come there without your allowance + no one can move you out from there.)
*   You do not have any obligations against it’s maintenance. (No one can even judge you on effectivity of its maintenance.)
*   You do not have any obligations at event of your destructing act. (Eventhough it is designed to be repaired by yourself then...)
*   (Even more you get it for free at some [special occasions] and you have quite [reach amount] of repairing resources yet.)
*   Personal-kit is not place-bounded!

1.  personal-field: this is **_private ownership_** except right to disallow others to come there

*   personal-field is excluded from 2yrs-circulation obligations by mean of “family-cluster”: if you use this, no one can move you out.

1.  co-house holder-role: ***
2.  co-house full-member role: ***
3.  co-house newcomer role: ***
4.  co-house client role: ***
5.  co-house visitor role: ***
6.  queue member: ***

#### Participation {#participation}

*   We understand our private comfort much more broadly: as right to influence by what we are surrounded: actually this makes sense for most inhabitants because these are not reach over-average to be able to isolate from outside powers
*   Therefore our biggest mean to carry our privacy is [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy)

### Right to equal opportunities {#right-to-equal-opportunities}

#### Private comfort 3 areas: private live, personal career, & personal consumption {#private-comfort-3-areas-private-live-personal-career-personal-consumption}

(“Private”) comfort is perceived in 3 areas: “private” live, personal “career”, & personal consumption:

*   _material & organizational means of “private” live (personal live in family & friends) -_- are “quite minimalistic” but still very comfortable; - are settled by very minimalistic “payments” - by 3 hrs of detaily structured - very healthy and peaceful work at diversified live areas.- are considered as incompatible with “work time” & “consumption funs” - and thus are protected from these 2 other areas.
*   _personal career_ - uses very sophisticated means allowing people:- to _find_ “self-realization work roles” very easily, - to _attain_ this work places very easily, &- to _sustain_ this professional qualifications very easily; here we have to count obligation of 1-2 yr movement _refresh-period_
*   _personal consumptions “above” (minimal live comfort)_ -- are regulated and controlled by electronic queues, which have to satisfy following range of criterias:- every-one has to have access to queue “_from time to time_”, where this _from time to time_ is equal for all- more frequent or bigger consumption access has to be balanced by “_settling plan_” which can be found at “_integrations market_” - market of balancing work roles

#### More notes about understanding and implementation of equality {#more-notes-about-understanding-and-implementation-of-equality}

From very beginning, let’s have clear view on how “equality” is understood at us:

*   1<sup>st</sup> of all, we definitively will never go for “equality” by _enforcing others_. We build “equality” upon environment of reach availability of thinkable self-realization possibilities. Places which offers this kind-of concur each to other; which is understanding of “_free market_” for us. Equality here is implemented by **_easiness_** of availability of thinkable self-realization possibilities to all here. We measure this easiness, we monitor it, and we train people to have ability of it regularly. This strictly contradicts with _communism ***_mindset of classes war.So to summarize what we do for this easiness:- We require from work places and market places to implement it to all there.- We require from work places and market places to allow us to monitor it there.- We require from work places and market places to cooperate to train it with all there.- We require from all our members to drill it there.
*   2<sup>nd</sup> of all, we definitively do not understand “equality” as “equality of everything”. We agree with opinion that people differ, that they have different _individual (self-realization) needs_, different ways of naming and self-organization. So most important aspect of our understanding of “equality” is **_easiness_** of changing place in society structure.We do not agree with _egalitarians_ _***mindset_ of “equality of everything”, so we should be considered as libertarian democrats: we propagate atmosphere of well-argued need of self-career self-sufficiency. **_But we call self as egalitarians because we implement self-career-prepared environment by picking people away from loans-like bonds slavery_**: see last meaning of “equality” here:
*   3<sup>rd</sup> after all, we still have sense “equality” in **_Basic-Needs_**. We implement it by free availibility of [Personal Kit].

### Right for information {#right-for-information}

This is key mean to our success from our point of view: sharing informations is possible in complete passivity: we distinguish between “data-sharing” and “material-sharing” radically. All our work time is recorded and “public” for whole company. The same for food & facilities consumption and for healthiness queues & monitoring.

*   We built huge knowledge-base upon this our sharing and we use it a much with great advantage.

### Right to be free from cruelty {#right-to-be-free-from-cruelty}

*   incorporates our monitoring system
*   includes right to be even economically free from cruel farming - like:- meat-factories like [battery hens](https://www.google.cz/search?site=&source=hp&q=battery+hen+cruelty+facts)- dermatology testing

#### Note on meat {#note-on-meat}

In mainstream, killing the animal for food is not considered to be a murd. -- It is arguable. But monetarization here makes big difference unfortunately: People got specialized in killing in order to drive “nice business”. In this way, killing and torturing much-artificially increased above arguable amount and is hidden behind monetized business model.

*   At us, we do not offer meat as a product: meat cannot be a product at us.
*   Our understanding is that eating meat and (natural) procuring of meat is completely OK, but this cannot include business.

→ so when someone wants meet he has to go (to visit or to live) to co-house with breed animals and kill one. It cannot be automated; killing act cannot be degraded to something hiding-able behind money or machines. Bigger animals makes bigger amount of meat: this cannot be stored in products-sheds and offered in business: every piece of meat is stored in local freezer and available (with video-tracking) for anybody there: nearer bidder of the minute wins. No reservations allowed.

#### Note on pills and hygiene {#note-on-pills-and-hygiene}

We believe dermatologically-safe formulas had tested already enough.

*   we just use those “out of active commercial producers interest”

### Accessibility of “nice things” {#accessibility-of-nice-things}

Beside strong rights we join in cooperation to make some things _very_ easily accessible. We hold it by to namings:

*   “_easy-access preparation_” - is done mainly by trainings in Info-sources orientation, Queues, and wide-spread crowd of temporal stores (transit Sheds)
*   “_easy-access help_” - is done by practical trainings, and supporting roles - Couches, Informers, & Coordinators

This nice things include beside others: easy-access and therefore frequent use of:

*   rights mitigation help - done mainly in sessions with couches
*   health-care services - eg. almost everybody uses service of massage
*   career and edu. consultancies - done mainly in sessions with informers
*   transportation availability - (is of course free) - only seat must be booked...

Here right understanding comes to be important:

*   we have _everything for comfortable daily-life insurance_ just at place (of living) -- near to [tent]
*   when we want something “extraordinary” above that, we have to travel for it - with moving our whole residence: this is common and often. It is cheap and easy. (And obligatory from time to time.)

### Zones {#zones}

We use -as other companies- _zones_ to protect “inner values”:

*   **_red zone_** - for contact with general outside people: this serves mainly 2 purposes: 1/public propagation of “_our implementation_”, and 2/sold public-destined products
*   **_yellow zone_** - for moments, where inner quality is not ensured: bigger events with partially verified clients from outside
*   **_green zone_** - for “regular” (inner) live
*   **_blue zone_** - for live - where “hard” values needs to be protected
*   **_white zone_** - where anonymity of _electronic_ interaction is made for “hard” values protection

For completeness, let’s name yet some special zones:

*   **_brown zone_** - regular (non-promotional) long-term interactions with outer world: obligations to government, deals with long-term external suppliers, care of relatives
*   **_orange zone_** - cooperation events between “islands”: large events, where outer injection cannot be generally prevented
*   **_violin zone_** - situations & means of stopping destructive aggressivity
