## Qualities of all work positions - related to living in general {#qualities-of-all-work-positions-related-to-living-in-general}

*   All work positions are based on mechanical work. (Performance based and improvisation is disregarded.)
*   All work positions are “equally paid” - Actually those are not paid at all: in terms of money. Only compensations realized by membership rights: are naturals/services-based and are made by engaged co-house.
*   All work positions have same shifts timing - in 3x 1-2hrs periods (nature, tech, social)
*   All service-oriented work positions are done in doubled workers - at minimal.

You can specialize in anything you want in any age you want. (This is to be frequent - thus normal.)

*   But no-one can escape from 3-periods model. This model is considered a key value of our organization. So during life here it goes such that some work - in some period is your “cup of specialization” and others are of “want - don’t want” area but those areas are considered as _saving your health_.
*   You can invest your “free time” to extend some “working period” up to 2hrs more, but: 1/ it cannot goes continually after your working period immediately - it must be interspersed with period of other area; 2/ in more time you are not allowed to go to that working area.

Specialization is what makes the career / “economical” grow for an individual. Renome / qualification in specialization is what you will get with you.

So every position has:

*   at least 2 place-workers, where at least 1 is mentor for trainees
*   at least 1 trainee
*   as many as possible of applicants in Queue

Basic households 'IO' (income--outcome) principle is -

- everyone serves his 'primary' need in his 3x 1st-hrs - obligatory periods. Most of us uses there such technologies which helps generate quite big overproduction without any rush or mess or stress! Our housing, feeding, wearing, hygiene, & kindergartening is always here - without any payment - only because of our 3hrs obligatory periods.

- we do not need to fall to loans to be housed, we do not need to race unfair prices to get living resources for our family, we do not need to collaborate on corruption to get normal services for our lives, we do not need to join aggressive and misusing 'games' to gain career.

In this sense - working place is highly shared:

*   Eg. in place of 8-hrs service we have at least 8 people working:09AM - A, 010AM - A, B, trainee-111AM - C, B, trainee-112:00 - C, D13PM - E, D, trainee-2, trainee-314PM - E, F, trainee-2, trainee-315PM - G, F16PM - G, 0
*   Here worker B and worker E has status of trainer and they trains 3 students there.
