## Common heritage {#common-heritage}

We appreciate and protect these:

*   bio-sphere heritage
*   human-race heritage
    *   technologies heritage
    *   material-facilities heritage
    *   cultural & service-caring heritage

### Relation to clans-based inheritance {#relation-to-clans-based-inheritance}

*   We do not support clans-based inheritance - in opposite to private proprietorship
*   What this type of inheritance had to fulfill - this is carried by public-facilities accessibility

### Relation to tech {#relation-to-tech}

*   We definitively support & enjoy tech equipment. - We understand it as important part of common heritage
*   - But we protect ourselves against:
    1.  accessibility distortions: based on ownership mangling, and on price games
    2.  usage distortions: manly mass-media toolings mainly in “work” positions are used unhealthily

Our principal understanding of availability of sophisticated facilities and all other heritage is realized by (tuned) sharing. -- Imagine tractor, sewing machine, piano, availability of repairing factories, educative travelings, … everything (not included in personal-kit precisely).
