# Some last ongoing projects {#some-last-ongoing-projects}

## Documentary "engine" itself

Red zone of our KB is publicized at <u>SCPP (Solution Concepts of Peoples’ Projects)</u>; most emphasized view at this portal is STPP (SPECs-Tree of Peoples’ Projects).
-	“PP” points to Parallel-Polis
-	SPECs-Tree is 2D View where People are sorted out on Y-axis, and Projects are sorted out on X-axis. (Or vice versa.)
Particular sorting and filtering makes visible strongest (in representation) Solution and which Needs it supports and/or not-support.

### Similarity to (OSS) voting-systems
Main purpose of our KB is to sort-out (and visualize)

1.	***Needs*** and ***Solutions***. This maps 1:1 to [Problems and Proposals](http://www.opendcn.org/index.php/en/strumenti/problems-and-proposals) of [opendcn.org](http://www.opendcn.org/index.php/en) and also it tightly maps to [*Values* -- *Objectives*+*Policies*](http://www.democracylab.org/vision) of [democracylab.org](http://www.democracylab.org). We use those terms too.
    What we can emphasise here is that we name starting point as *Need* because from our perspective good formulation of *problem* is in terms of Need, and *Proposal* should be oriented toward public as *Solution of some concrete Need*.
    This way also we nicely experience that *formulation of need* is not something absolute*.
    
2.   Then we vote for- (or "against"-) every that *need **formulation*** and *solution **proposal***. This way we gather large understanding of 
     - (potential) *preferences* of our community.
     - *potential* of each formulation.
     - *potential partners* of each of us.
       <br />
       
3.   What seems to be unique here at us is, that voter votes for *what s/he wants*, not for propagator wants: Let's say, that the originating author has a "blog" post, describing several *Values*, *Objectives* and *Policies* in several sentences each. The evaluating voter comes then and marks just those sentences which he want to *comment and interpret"; s/he do so and if willing, s/he explicitly assess the *quoted range* by a number in interval of $$0-1$$: completely disagree -- completely agree.

4.   By this way, new and new ranges are generated, still what is evaluated is every sentence particularly from the cited source. This way also we track preferences in *labeling phenomena* itself:  

5.   Votings are made by these comments posted; what is usefull is that you can select a intended quoted range by ***query***. -- This can make ***evaluations varying (conditionaly) in the time***.



### Spectography / Filtering

Our KB is organized as Semantic Wiki, with Sentence-oriented versioning, with several analysis and visualising extensions:

1.  1$$st$$ of all, we do not put negative numbers in the assessment. In our *raw-view*, we can only *distance* ourself from a statement. By this view, we can make 1$$st$$ filter by masking unfilled relations by $$0.5$$.

2.  Next, we incorporate *time / versioning*.

3.  Next, we incorporate (simple) *logic*: at this view, we use negative numbers for contradiction. This also can incorporate *conditioning* of atomic elements (the sentences) -- parameterization of the filter.

4.  Next, we incorporate *decomposition analysis*: we can increase assessment value when *parts* are positively evaluated and vice versa. In fact, evaluation is tracked by every single sentence. 

5.  Next, we incorporate *synthetic computation*: This implements  *conditioning* of compounds -- the terms, paradigms and projects.


## Documentary of recent Attempts world-wide {#documentary-of-recent-attempts-world-wide}

We are now for example working on documentary movie about some exemplary attempts on humanity implementation or humanity promotion.

### “Partial projects” -- designed for “ordinary-people” {#partial-projects-designed-for-ordinary-people}

-- These projects are designed as places where people cannot “live” - i.e.: where people cannot cooperate on production of personal / family needs of live. -- But from our perspective then this projects can be counted as valid humanity contributors only if those help the attendants to live healthy & happily -- sustainably and fully. -- This is not trivial task, but main responsibility is on attendants them-selves.

All of these projects are from our perspective partial-only, but we accept them simply as “partial projects”. Lets say that here are 2: 1/ small NGO/s and 2/ institutes:

*   Plum Village - humanity wakening up contribution, small contact with true farming
*   [TTZM](www.ic.org/directory/the-transcendent-zeitgeist-movement-ttzm/)
*   Project Venus, Zeitgeist movement - tech understanding and solution contribution
*   Ami Institute - humanity wakening up contribution
*   [**wwoof**](http://www.wwoof.net) - enabling contact with good farming
*   [domyZeSlamyaHliny.cz](http://www.domyzeslamyahliny.cz/) - tech solution contribution

### Massmedia attempts {#massmedia-attempts}

*   Both organizations-held and individual attempts are valuable.

Happy society - social approach

*   [theVenusProject.com](http://thevenusproject.com) - all medias
*   [theZeitgeistMovement.com](http://thezeitgeistmovement.com) - mainly ZeitGeist Addendum
*   [GreystonBakery.com](http://greystonbakery.com/) - humanity wakening up + [SocioCracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy)
*   [socionet.us](http://www.socionet.us/) - [SocioCracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy)
*   [whyPoverty.net](http://whypoverty.net)
*   [transparency.org](http://transparency.org)

Happy individuals, small groups interactions

*   non-violent communication
*   mindfulness in schools
*   eco-living documentaries

Just something

*   Earth - Home
*   Baraka, Cronos, *quaci/s

### Religion, doctrine, lineage -attached attempts {#religion-doctrine-lineage-attached-attempts}

*   sikhs - seems like most “pure” formation around mono-teistic doctrine
*   hutterites - only acceptable christianity-based attempt
*   [zenPeaceMakers.org](http://zenpeacemakers.org)
*   ..

### Projects designed as communities {#projects-designed-as-communities}

-- We expects from them mainly commitment to humanity / kindness.

*   ubuntuParty.za
*   Tinker’s Bubble
*   [openSourceEcology.org/gvcs](http://opensourceecology.org/gvcs/)
*   Hutterites
*   [Happy Farmers](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/happy-farmers-will-change-the-world)
*   GreySton Bakery
*   [ekovesnice.cz](http://www.ekovesnice.cz)
*   …

-- We are looking for physical implementers (like @ OSE, or like documented @ PM), but which are already transformed higher from level of one-man-show like Venus did.
