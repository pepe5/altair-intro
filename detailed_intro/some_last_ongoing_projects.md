## Some last ongoing projects {#some-last-ongoing-projects}

### Documentary of recent Attempts world-wide {#documentary-of-recent-attempts-world-wide}

We are now for example working on documentary movie about some exemplary attempts on humanity implementation or humanity promotion.

#### “Partial projects” -- designed for “ordinary-people” {#partial-projects-designed-for-ordinary-people}

-- These projects are designed as places where people cannot “live” - i.e.: where people cannot cooperate on production of personal / family needs of live. -- But from our perspective then this projects can be counted as valid humanity contributors only if those help the attendants to live healthy & happily -- sustainably and fully. -- This is not trivial task, but main responsibility is on attendants them-selves.

All of these projects are from our perspective partial-only, but we accept them simply as “partial projects”. Lets say that here are 2: 1/ small NGO/s and 2/ institutes:

*   Plum Village - humanity wakening up contribution, small contact with true farming
*   [TTZM](www.ic.org/directory/the-transcendent-zeitgeist-movement-ttzm/)
*   Project Venus, Zeitgeist movement - tech understanding and solution contribution
*   Ami Institute - humanity wakening up contribution
*   [www.](http://www.wwoof.net)[**wwoof**](http://www.wwoof.net)[.net](http://www.wwoof.net) - enabling contact with good farming
