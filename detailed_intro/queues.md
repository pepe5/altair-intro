 ## Queues {#queues}

We already said that we use queues for (practically) everything what we want to reach.

Queues is core technology mean which we have to implement vision of our values.

*   most of queues are ‘green’: i.e.: 1/ transparently readable for (our) public2/ publicly writable - anyone (of us) can join it
*   most of queues are “moderator free” ***

### types INTRO {#types-intro}

Basic 3 types are these:

1.  **_new queue_** - every new queue need time to reach the public: in this it’s stage all joining ‘applicants’ are going to unordered pool. Then there is announcement of ‘Q’ day including conditions by which Q transitions to ordered stage; then there is again settling period; and ‘Q’ day itself.
2.  **_established queue_** - ordered ones serves basic purpose: “_1st comes 1st goes for_”. In moment when you are just in front - one ready to go for the thing: you get notification about it and then availability of the thing is going through availability-expiration _‘timeout_’ period.
3.  **_non/drying queues_** - Not-drying Qs are those one, where it’s objects are delivered by it’s fans-club always in advance and in bigger amount than current amount of applicants.Having queues emptying is oftenly used as measuring factor of reaching level of vision implementation. We implement emptying queues by sheds, work-positions redundancy, tent-docks redundancy, facilities redundancy and statistics-based (instead of consolidation-based) planning.

If there would be a reason for exceptions in order, then it is not solved by exceptioning, but by:

*   **_parallel queues_** - also transparent ones…For co-house culture-holder, making parallel queue for establishing above-standard services could be a risky way - potentially ending up in losing holdership or even in establishing emigration plan.So after wise thinking, best implementation of parallel queue is establishing parallel co-house.

Creation of queue is based on identification of _‘object kind’_ - we call it _‘class’_. - Because having this kind of wanted thing we are able to sense periodicity:

*   we cannot say _“i want this - particular thing - which is already away”_
*   we can say _“i want this kind of thing. -- Similar kind of thing which have been here”_

*   **_nested queues_** - are those to which you are subscribed by applying to parent queue.
*   **_substitutional queues_** - are those which are offered to you in moment of subscription to similar queue

*   having queues related with these relations - is important part of our KB.
*   having things related with these relations - is important part of our KB.

Queues (availability) cannot be conditioned other way than by membership. In other words we do not have any facilities, services, or whatever what could be conditioned other way than by membership and queues. So we have:

*   **_universal Qs_** - are realized by all land covering sheds, and public-oriented co-houses
*   **_membership-based Qs_** - are realized by sheds and co-house areas physically inaccessible for our public: yes, we also use locks and guides in green zone - but only for modifying consumption. Observing of the thing has to be available for all still as observing that queue.
*   **_placement-based Qs_** - are universal, but picking up the thing can be done only from the place. So entrance to queue is conditioned by your physical location. Here your location is what serves your right to free accessibility: move on to thing please.

#### **_Qs from perspective of newcomer_** - {#Qs-from-newcomers}

We orientate between Qs without confusion, but for newcomers it is often hard to understand this great source of knowledge and possibilities. So let's count some orienting points yet for them: Mainstream poeple do not know Qs; what is most similiar in theirs world are ***projects***, but we have to understand deep difference of that: *goal of project* is *to finish*; *goal of queue* is *to flow forever*.

- *(well established) long-time running projects* (for ***"established queues"***) - are those which has enough voting-supporters, bidders, well-known clients, and (real)-fans / active-supporters already long time. Goal for active-supporters can be here to repeat sustainability drills; to tune up little-bit sustainability factors; or to go through fail-over drills. Important part of sustainability of this queues' infrastructure is ***complex-circulation***: recycling increases attractivity of project great.
- *drying projects* (for ***drying queues***) - are those where bidders amount is bigger than needed (real)-fans amount. Actual goal for active-supporters is to become part set up convenient environment for the newcomers.
- *starting-up big projects* (for ***"new queues"***) - are those which has enough bidders / voting-supporters and fans / active-supporters already long time. As big projects: definitive goal of active-supporters is to become part of *established queues*.
- *local-interest projects* - dominant mainstream perspective: without any sense of ***inter-connectedness***.


### benefits from having queues {#benefits-from-having-queues}

By having queues we gain knowledge, track, and prognosis about:

*   amount of bidders at the moment, and at summary, ...
*   frequency and dynamics of intensity of applications (INs) and usages (OUTs)
*   typical profile of applicant- useful for the-thing producers - fans-club. -- I.E.: what could be related to attractivity, what could simplify availability, SWOT source, ...- useful for the-thing seekers. -- I.E.: what s/he needs for - mainly in membership-based and placement-based queues
*   classifying the thing and finding similarities to other classes

### universal (all company members inclusive) Qs {#universal-all-company-members-inclusive-qs}

Lets count briefly what we consume - and therefore we have ‘under’ queues:

*   personal place, tent place, field place, ...
*   materials - like food, water, IT-storage, tools, facilities, ...
*   energies - like electricity, IT-transactions, ...
*   relations / living time - like services, deals, animals’ relations, …

From the other side - producers delivers to Qs too:

*   products which are important has to be produced redundantly - without “any” single-point-of-failure. Diversity of producers, of tracks, of sheds, and of timing is “mandatory” (has to be developed in advance before detaching “experimental” label from the flow). -- _“_**_redundancy-Qs_** _of important-flows”_
*   products which are not important - those bit a luxury kinds - are also negotiated through **_dealing-Qs_**. This construct uniquely our construction process: bidder goes to potential producer and by communication they make a Q: they have by this some obligations in front of them: eg. 1/ to have communication digitalized, and 2/ to make a delay as a space for other potential sub/suppliers.

### Qs to membership {#qs-to-membership}

### Qs to usage (consumption of time slots) {#qs-to-usage-consumption-of-time-slots}

### Qs to consumptions (of materials) {#qs-to-consumptions-of-materials}

Let's describe what our queues concept means for simple man mainly: Most people (in amount) reaches theirs live-consumption material (for mainstream presented by corporations as ‘consumer goods’) in hyper-markets+. As we [described](http://drive.google.com/open?id=1_WmdAeT4JpaNNRLEumzM6-qKFPdHVChXpPKE4AuK6Dg), this shows very poor position of consumers if front of corporation holders.

*   We do not have shops at all. We have showrooms and internet eshops.
*   The good cannot be presented in any other way than 1/ photo of purely itself without any decorations or even photomontage2/ textual descriptions of parameters - measured ones - no commentaries
*   In the eshop, you can of course search, sort, group, & explore deep background of goods by commentaries about it, but the presenting page cannot show this.

There is of course more things attached to the good beside photos and parameters, like those comentary forums, origins tracking, live-trackings of the pieces, live-chats of its fans, & e-portals helping the gathering, construction and distribution around the good to flow. Everything just available for all. (No restrictions, no payments. The authentication in original sense is made automatically without any need of interaction by personal kit. (E)-robots are not problem at us, because every query must be authenticated, and every program/system has some physical owner - a man who started it - trackable.)

#### **_catalog photos_** - {#catalog-photos}

*   cannot show anything else than how the good looks like in moment of consumption
*   There is not allowed any part of surrounding, any parts of the consumers, painting or text over that.
*   No packaging can be shown on the photo too. Even when packaging can be important part of product selection. As commentaries, the packaging as well is restricted to be part of “2<sup>nd</sup> click”: you can use full-text for this.

#### **_catalog parameters_** - {#catalog-parameters}

*   are going to be main criteria for product selection.
*   we compute all thinkable non-numeric and numeric parameters for the goods. (Categorizations, usage statistics, content components, geometric - mechanical - and tests statistics, geographic background, laws related, …) For example, we can choose cheese by color, type name, age, and origin location. Or we can chose new model of personal-KIT tablet by number of users and breakdown rates.
*   We do not use monetized prices; (why we would do it? - We do not pay money for anything). If someone is interested in prices - s/he is going to look on [_hrs/vectors_]: this are important parameters for serious fans of the good in moments of _shortage_. (If we would use monetized prices, or as we request from our collaborators, then it must be always only _unit price_.)
*   So (when we do not pay for anything), then **_availability_** is only factor interesting for us, right? The background which constitutes availability is _Qs mechanics_.

### availability expiration - timeout {#availability-expiration-timeout}

*   is only timing mean used in our company granularized to smaller units than hours!
*   it is conditioned by clear notification or also with waiting for confirmation:

There can be different levels when expiration of thing-availability starts:

*   after delivery of notification
*   after displaying / reading headline
*   after displaying / reading all lines
*   after ‘i got it’ feedback
*   after yes/no feedback
*   after handover arrangement proclamation
*   after handover arrangement certification

From perspective of applicant position in moment when thing-availability expires, the applicant can be positioned:

*   to the end of queue again … **_rapid queues_**
*   to the 2nd slot still … **_serious queues_**
*   to the 2nd slot if s/he expresses confirmation to official questioning … **_monitored queues_**

### Qs - decisionmaking ones {#qs-decisionmaking-ones}

*   **_green-mode decisioning Qs_ **are written questions to the board.Everyone can make such question. Then, there can be made (written) bid to (co-house) culture-charter:
*   **_yellow-mode Qs_**: culture-impacting voting. Full members can step into protective position:
*   **_blue-mode Qs_**: non-members are called to help protecting the status quo
