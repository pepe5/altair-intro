## Indicators-mastering drill {#indicators-mastering-drill}

we have some values and we have detailed KB of _contra-indicators_ which helps us detect social situations and personal postures which can be destructive against it. -

- If someone goes to do that at alone, s/he is entering blue-state by that. If someone goes to do that at situation with other people, s/he directs him/her self towards the process of leaving us by that.

### we do not do some things here {#we-do-not-do-some-things-here}

*   see **3**ε / **_3MTs_ **training

place holder cannot ask newcomer

*   if s/he can get lunch out of his/her family
*   if s/he can get holding duty
*   if s/he can do some work-non-related favorsetc.

### we all do some things here {#we-all-do-some-things-here}

*   obligations of 3hrs basic-works - trained in [basic-school] trainings
*   obligations of violete-state - trainings starts from those simplest things already in [basic-school] -- see [emphatic games], but those becomes obligated at age of 15yrs. (The day of sexuality self-realization becoming legal.) *** From this day trainings continue becoming harder: preparing a man to day of 18yrs, where s/he can join physical-op/s ([Cop position] training).

### we all do not say some formulations {#we-all-do-not-say-some-formulations}

We all agree with

*   that expressions directly reflects postures and
*   that some postures simply doesn’t work in our company

We are basically propagators of “non-violent culture”:

*   we accept that other cultures exists, but we have chosen that not here at us
*   “culture” means “dominating mind-set”: some mind-labels simply doesn’t exist in our mind-sets because otherwise it would be different mind-set: we have different labels for relevant situation characteristics:
*   we say that such a label is **_out-of-fashion_**: in “meaning” of that propagating mind-set is understood as **_superannuated_** at us.

#### progress planning: {#progress-planning}

in trainings of [social period] we learn how to deal with [_stress-sources_], and you will learn that -

*   we do not accept any formulations of progress promises of forecasts longer than till upcoming midnight.
*   That means in work, that you cannot promise task-progress longer than 1-2hrs.
*   When we do not use promises about future progress _timing_, this doesn’t mean that we do not use planning: we use very _deeply detailed planning about structures and roles_ for future, but not about its timing.
*   See more at training of [Immunity against assertivity].

#### propagandas against 3ε / 3MTs {#propagandas-against-3-3mts}

we do not accept here:

*   propagandas of **_violence_ **and rights to violence: label “**_fight_**” is outdated. We use this label only when we want to mark such way of thinking as outdated… (for example when talking about mainstream, or when talking to someone propagating by words or by physical interaction such posture)
*   propagandas of human-rights **_inequality_ **and arguings toward this inequality: Label “**_prohibited_**” is outdated: if there is theme of “prohibition” in atmosphere, we are going to focus rather to chances to move around…Label “**_guilt_**” and “**_punishment_**” are outdated: there is _misunderstanding_ and _protection of surroundings_ (or of his/her own future when we talk about children).
*   propagandas of **_lying / hiding_ **and rights to lying/hiding: we do not have **_secret_** matters except these 3:
    1.  personal / family comfort -- ensured by personal-kit
    2.  personal / family problems -- ensured by blue-zone
    3.  hard-values -- ensured by white-zone

#### no lying - no advertisements {#no-lying-no-advertisements}

*   we do not use advertisements in common sense: we use strictly-raw descriptions in our business and strictly-public formulations there
*   see [products consumption]

#### no blaming - no unconstructive criticism {#no-blaming-no-unconstructive-criticism}

Critical thinking is important part of intelligence and as such it is important part of common heritage. But unfortunately you can by “_critical_ without _thinking_”: which we try to overcome.

So when someone says something critical, we focus on finding _what_ s/he is critical _to_. It is always toward something. It can be:

*   **_towards him/her self_**: → then we need to ensure that s/he has good self-understanding and self-acceptance. In other words we accept here only funny-sweet self criticism.
*   **_towards other people_**: → then we need to ensure that s/he is not violent to them. → We do not accept here -- _harming criticism,_→ but rather we practice here -- _warning_ and/or _warming criticism_.This is our important regulation: no one can be judged if s/he did not receive warning in advance! Any critic which is intended to be warning/warming must be _delivered_ to the object of that critical thinking. Our [video-tracking KB] helps us in implementation of this a lot.We are encouraged to warn someone who steps over our indicators / values.
*   **_towards some system_**: In atmosphere of professionalism/consumerism in mainstream, people are used to blame covering system/s a lot to make themselves to ease. At us, we are trying to overcome consumerism/professionalism so blaming the system moves the actor to blue-zone. → Then it is evaluated if the actor blames objective lacks in the system or if s/he expresses _subjective_ frustration:→ we are encouraged to sharpen our skill of objective criticism.→ we are encouraged to soften our tendency to subjectively blame.There is system of public recursive evaluation on what subjective and what objective is.

Critics regulation is implemented in personal-profile:

*   we count in personal skills an ability of _objective finding_ and _warning-warming_ soft skill.
*   we count in personal limits a fragility of falling to subjective interpretations and harming.

-- actually, this characteristic is one of few ones used to qualify a person to be eligible to come to white-zone fans-club.
