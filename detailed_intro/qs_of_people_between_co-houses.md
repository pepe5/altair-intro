## Qs of people between co-houses {#qs-of-people-between-co-houses}

Let's make a note about a man in world of co-houses. We are going from co-house to co-house and what we can expect in general?

*   All members of a co-house are equal to each other in terms of access to the co-house equipment and to the co-house positioning trainings -- no matter what qualification the person currently is in. In case of cascaded trainings, it must be available every path road used by any member present.
*   Every co-house must have defined amount of newcomer vacancies per year - and have transparent queue to there. The amount is defined by transparent voting of company board, and co-house clients. IE from outside. If limits goes above members’ agreement, the co-house falls under directed expansion. Co-house cannot protect itself against expansion.

So - people are equal to each other, but co-houses are unequal from definition:

*   You can go to reach co-house or you can go to poor co-house - somehow interesting for you, but you always have easy chance to go away!
*   When you are some co-house losing a profit due to unlucky influence of another co-house → you can ask for _clustering-balance._ If disbalance is caused by opposite co-house certification, you can always go the for gaining it and become valuable contributor for the small one.
*   Co-houses are here to feel always freely independent from other co-houses. No co-house is allowed to dictate to another one what to use. Startups have always attainable path road at us.
