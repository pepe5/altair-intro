## IO: red-zone economy {#io-red-zone-economy}

Because we are -

*   tracking every move of our people in work,
*   tracking every move of our materials here
*   tracking every change in positions, “responsibilities”, plans-declarations

- we are also doing the same for what comes inside our borders, and what is going.

### Counting “clusters” {#counting-clusters}

We are structured to levels:

*   we are individuals -- joining “individuals-cluster” -- the “homes” -- usually families
*   families (and other homes) -- joins co-house -- usually “farm” -- sharing “culture intention”
*   farms -- joins “farms circle island” -- can survive in long term -- shares “material resources”
*   islands -- joins for diversity protection, for quality of live, and for fun - to “islands cluster Net”: islands in net are intensively inter-changing people, so they are tightly bonded and inter-dependent on organizational level. -- Shares people & data. From juridical perspective islands-cluster is a company.
*   Nets -- are joining to [blue sphere service***] -- mutual quality care: The Nets are organizationally separated: they are providing to each other only auditing services and [Orange happenings]. -- Shares charter & audits.

-- more about differences and details in [Cosmology]

Important part of clusters concept is **_cluster-balancing_**.

*   Everyone can raise a cluster-balancing process of any cluster to protect cluster members' _possibilities/power_.

#### Minimal personal resources IO {#minimal-personal-resources-io}

*   counting daily amounts - field m<sup>2</sup>, litres, kgs, …

_Personal field: - is what everyone have to become familiar with._

*   _we spend there 1-3hrs every day_
*   _we know what it needs every day - every month - every year_
*   _we know what it gives to us: what food materials, what wearing materials, what housing materials, what tooling materials._

→ *** lets count its IO

### Biggest outcomes {#biggest-outcomes}

We are of course trying to “keep outcomes on minimum” - in sense of properties - which are not part of thoroughly-permitted projects. So here are:

*   insurance taxes
*   pensions
*   buying still-not self-sustainable materials

So for these we have to generate equal incomes.

We have some regulations which income is available for what and they are buffered in funds.

*   For example landscape donations cannot be used for compensations of above listed outcomes…

Beside property outcomes of course we have “services outcomes” and in this area we are trying to be as much active as possible. Main field here is red zone, but also orange-fests and brown-fields are here too. Please read about them theirs own chapters.

### Biggest incomes {#biggest-incomes}

1st of all, we have to say, that we work here in limits boundaries:

*   web-page offering services always includes easily-visible link to discounts: we have 4-prices policy: for business, for NGOs, for “personal use”, and for “supported projects”.
*   Prices have to be always visible without need to geting into two-ways interaction: filling (more and more) form prices (more and more).

So we mainly offer:

*   crafting services
*   educational programs - for both children and for adults
*   children & elders nursery
*   IT services

### Counting newcomers & leavers {#counting-newcomers-leavers}

*   *** material & licensings conditions of coming & going

### Counting estates {#counting-estates}

*   **lands**, factory-”**houses**”, health-care “houses”
*   **heavy machines**: tractors, diggers, engines, power-plants, metal-foundries, machining-toolings, ...
*   **precise toolings**: physical & chemical meters & indicators, robots, autonomous-automation, “specialists” health-care toolings, ...
*   **interactivity facilities**: sweat & swiming rooms, facility “stores”, IT, personal health-care toolings, ...

-- we share these estates to “save money” & to deliver rich experience to our employees.

-- we choose such models & designs of the estates - which are “eco”, modular, & easy-care.
