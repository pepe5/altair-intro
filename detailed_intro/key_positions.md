## Key positions {#key-positions}

*   Everyone can specialize on his/her own will. This is the same in whole world - where it is enabled. For us - specialization is main mean for _career_.
*   Everyone has (at least) 3 specializations in which s/he grows independently (nature farming, tech one, & social one).

### Informer specialization {#informer-specialization}

There are people largely mastering basic / special compendium of information needed for living here. Social period of work for these people is for educating other in what they need.

*   for a client: informer is something like “one touch coach”: S/he is asked -by a client- mostly to say _what to do_, or _what is what_.
*   when a client need something more, typically when s/he want to achieve through more days, then s/he goes to coach:

### Coach specialization {#coach-specialization}

2nd important role in our society is coach. It is the person which likes friendship and physical contact and to listen in all forms. S/he helps to make people be aware of theirs wishes and theirs perception on actual possibilities-situation.

*   for a client: coach is **_representant_** / interface **_between_ **on one side a **_bare_ **client’s **_authenticity_ **(which is here to be happy, healthy, strong, fresh, able to work, to relax, to be compassionate, to be interactive, & to be creative) **_and_** “a system”: indefinitely complicated impersonal socio-technocratic “black-box” below us: something like “the Earth” - we rely on that and we appreciate that, but in contrast to Earth (which is Mother to us), the system has project-oriented requirements to us, and we cannot integrate with it by our simple (deeply personal authenticity), but only by (impersonal) **_abstracting intellect_**.
*   2<sup>nd</sup> role of coach is: to be something like _spiritual guide_ for a client. Coach helps a client **_to name_** different aspects in client’s live - and by that to decide _how_ the client goes to perceive himself/herself in his/her live.

*   as “system representant”, coach helps to name different client goals in project-oriented perspective, but let’s note that we do not use _time-tracking_; only _points-tracking_. [See Indicators-mastering]
*   like many informers are normal in “a clients” live, more coaches are normal as well.

As anybody else, couch can recommend to client (to company about client) some specific training when s/he sees that client is falling to unconstructive naming constructs… And as in general, the client in such case can claim about biased judgement - and ask by that for plurilateral tests. As we all are going ordinary to our trainings, it should not be problem (any stress for the client himself/herself).

### Rescue works - 24h-shifts {#rescue-works-24h-shifts}

*   hospital (“intensive-care”) workers - blue zone
*   technical rescuers (coming to household means blue zone)
*   fire works (coming to household means blue zone)
*   “protectors works” - victims protections - kind of police service - blue zone;see Cops

### Cops -- Assistants {#cops-assistants}

*   are representants of “the system” in strict sense. They have rights to enter blue-zone, when they work as blue-zone cops; they have rights to requests obligations from the clients.
*   on the other side they have obligations to satisfy requests of clients when they are asked for: in this way, we do not have mainstream government-plebs roles hierarchy:When client of our company (a government analogy) asks an assistant for a service (officer-worker analogy), then assistant is disallowed to send client to another assistant, but instead of this s/he has to be with client till the moment when service is satisfied.
