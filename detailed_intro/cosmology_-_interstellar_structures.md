### Internal “economy” {#internal-economy}

*   *** counting man-hrs, workers to clients ratio for each service
*   *** counting kg, litres, plants, m<sup>2</sup>, kWh, … per co-house, per man-hrs

#### Perspective of parallel milestones {#perspective-of-parallel-milestones}

Ad blue: We can understand blue relating in 2 ways:

*   When related entities are too near to each other, so tendentious interaction have to be inhibited, we talk about **_blue membrane_**.
*   When relating entities are too far from each other, we talk about blue channels of **_blue network_ **of blue sphere service.

## Humanistic Evolucionism
### Note on Conspiracies

We have many fans of *conspiracy theories*. (The same way as we have Anarchists here, Comunnists, Preppers, Hippies, Channelists, and all other kinds of *Religions*.)

But one Conspiracy is connected with our fundamentals: Vendeta-Movement. I personally believe - as many of us, that Slavery-propagating Islam was imported to Europe by CIA in response to [Occupy Wallstreet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement): just to show public masses what is West. This is just matter of course in current ***[Neo-feudalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-feudalism)*** (namely ***[Disaster Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine)***).

### Corporations

We (or at least many of us) believe that ***[Corporatocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatocracy)*** is natural successor of globalizing (federating) democracies. We cannot stop it. 

On the other hand if we accept our form of living as good implementation of Human Rights - Wellbeing-based "Democracy" mean, we can easily label it as succeeding form of Civilation: If we sustain well (our 2 highest priorities):

- well accessible - fully transparent information
- easily accessible relocation possibilitiess

-- then we can easily thing about our Companies-Network as about new Civilization form of [City-states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City-state). We support this idea: as best successor of Corporatocracy: In future days, life of big populations will be completelly dependent on theirs employers-corporations. The states will be mostly paralyzed by dependency on corporations. But if there will be "good" corporations, then at least this can be a rescue for seekers of happy and valuable live. There will be many bad corporations, and the same way many good corporations: We will try our best.


### Evolution of models in Co-Houses "competition"

Our co-houses can grow and the same way they can decline.

- As we have right to freely and easily move between our co-houses, and as we know about each co-house everything, we naturally move to those where it goes best way.
- Consequently, some co-houses need bigger fields, some are in situations where other co-houses "somehow" asks for theirs fields instead...
- Every co-house has obligation ***to accept any newcomer***: this way, every co-house has to be supported in it's growth. Co-house can grow big in general, but it has to satisfy needs of clients, newcomers, and all members: Otherwise if claim arises, there is obligation for *"Mitosis"*.
- Every co-house has obligation ***to sustain the service***: if co-house has such small amount of members, that it cannot serve the service, it has to hand-over the service to new immigrants-wave. Claims about bad service can of course arise from any client, any newcomer, or any member: Process of investigations resulting in voting is performed.

-- This way our co-houses and its' villages grow and decline: and best-suitted cultures are *evolutionary growing*.
