## [Labeling-schools](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SH2-8T2CcO1Nis8u1FZCpH5bMgdRCyQjehn9wfE4f6s) _insight trainings_ {#labeling-schools-insight-trainings}

*   are described in [Acceptance with kindness] in detail, but let’s summarize here some key and technical points:
*   **_Labeling schools_** - are organizations and movements which manifests by 2 aspects at the same time always: 1/ Labeling _terminology propaganda_ and 2/ Labeling _imperialism propaganda_-- These aspects cannot be separated. Only “solution” for those who wants _wise-kind_ realization of particular terminology - can do it by _mindful relinquishment on imperialism of used terminology_.
*   This is directly perceptible from word _labeling_ itself:1/ “We” label to be able to communicate and understand.2/ “We” label _territory_ - and “we” have compulsions to label like this everything and everywhere.
*   Our basic schools’ **_highest priority_** is to bring experience and behavioral chances impressing that: _only real_ value is 1/ _well-being on individual level_ and 2/ _golden rule on social level_-- Everything “else” we have to understand as 1/ it is here to realize highest priorities 2/ it is here to distort it.
*   Even when in many situations cannot see clearly what is here to realize highest priorities and what is here to distort it, still: 1/ highest priorities are highest 2/ we are here for never-tiring trying to realize highest priorities and to get insight what helps and what distorts. Most wise approach at beginning is to step out to side of [3E] values loudly and to be soft to all actually met “means”.
*   We help to **_get insight_** in it by trainings bringing number of _contemplative situations for experiencing_ it.
*   We help to **_get trained_** in to be used to _be immune against falling to slavery_ of _imperialism scare&desire_. (By slaves we understand both victims and blind propagators.)
*   Trainings includes eg.: **_behavioral exercises_ **and individual consultations with couches on immunity against:- violence on gender, on “black-sheeps”, on races, on elders, and on subordinates- violent, “religious”, business, and kleptocratic imperialism
*   **_Contemplative trainings_ **includes eg. experiencing:- all analogy in terms across religious systems: basic goodness, spirit, awakening heart, desire, fear, sin, violence, organized “help”, …- that differences exists but do not demonstrate that human can be treated as slave or that terminologic or dogmatic incompatibility indicates immorality

We fully support in diversity: even in our boards - there is space for big diversity:

*   we welcome labeling-schools diversity (which respects our implementation of humanity and humanity itself)
*   we welcome diverse eco-modelings (which respects our implementation of humanity and humanity itself)
*   we welcome diverse range of communities of interests:

Examples:

*   hand-made food -vs- auto-breeding and auto-cooking
*   plastic-free -vs- open-hw printing
*   long walks -vs- intensive transporting
*   whole-live traveling -vs- three-places occupiers (we do not allow less)
*   sleep after lunch & early wake-ups
*   sport clubs (we do not accept score tracking in sport meetings)
*   small-is-nice fan-clubs -vs- big-projects fan-clubs

Always we engage and train in mutual friendliness and cooperative attitude.

Examples: ***

#### We learn from real situations {#we-learn-from-real-situations}

*   we use videos from our daily works
*   we discuss it
*   we play how to deal it correctly
*   in “negative” examples we protect children from using videos about theirs kins & friends -- If the session is not [blue zone].
